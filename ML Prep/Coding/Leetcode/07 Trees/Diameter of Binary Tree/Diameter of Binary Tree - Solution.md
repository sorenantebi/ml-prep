# Diameter of Binary Tree - Solution

**Question:** [[Diameter of Binary Tree - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Easy

## Intuition

Any path has a single "highest" node where it turns; its length there is `height(left) + height(right)`. So compute heights bottom-up with a DFS and, at every node, update a global best with the sum of its two child heights.

## Approach

1. Define `dfs(node)` returning the height of `node` in nodes (`0` for null).
2. At each node, get `l = dfs(left)`, `r = dfs(right)`.
3. Update `best = max(best, l + r)` — the longest path bending at this node, in edges.
4. Return `1 + max(l, r)` as this node's height.
5. Call `dfs(root)` and return `best`.

## Code

```python
from typing import Optional

# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
	def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
		best = 0

		def dfs(node):
			nonlocal best
			if not node:
				return 0
			l, r = dfs(node.left), dfs(node.right)
			best = max(best, l + r)     # path that turns at this node
			return 1 + max(l, r)        # height passed up to the parent

		dfs(root)
		return best
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — each node is visited once.
- **Space:** `O(h)` — recursion stack (`O(n)` for a skewed tree).

## Other Approaches

- **Height per node (naive):** for every node compute `height(left) + height(right)` with a separate height call — Time `O(n^2)`, Space `O(h)`.

## Key Takeaway

"Return one thing to the parent, update a global answer with another" — the DFS returns a single-branch value (height) while the answer combines both branches. The same pattern solves Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum.
