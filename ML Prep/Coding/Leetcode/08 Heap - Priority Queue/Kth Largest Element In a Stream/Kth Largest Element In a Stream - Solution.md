# Kth Largest Element In a Stream - Solution

**Question:** [[Kth Largest Element In a Stream - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Easy

## Intuition

We only ever need the `k` largest values; everything smaller can never become the answer again. Keep those `k` values in a **min-heap of size `k`** — its root is exactly the `k`-th largest, and new values only need to be compared against that root.

## Approach

1. In `__init__`, heapify `nums` and pop the smallest element until the heap has at most `k` elements.
2. In `add`, push `val`; if the heap now has more than `k` elements, pop the minimum.
3. Return `heap[0]`, the smallest of the `k` largest values.

## Code

```python
from typing import List
import heapq


class KthLargest:
	def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
		self.k = k
		self.heap = nums[:]
		heapq.heapify(self.heap)
		while len(self.heap) > k:
			heapq.heappop(self.heap)

	def add(self, val: int) -> int:
		heapq.heappush(self.heap, val)
		if len(self.heap) > self.k:
			heapq.heappop(self.heap)  # discard the value that is no longer in the top k
		return self.heap[0]
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n log n)` for construction (heapify `O(n)` plus up to `n - k` pops), `O(log k)` per `add`.
- **Space:** `O(k)` — the heap never holds more than `k + 1` elements after construction.

## Other Approaches

- **Sorted list:** keep all values sorted and insert with `bisect.insort`, then read index `-k` — Time `O(n)` per add (shifting), Space `O(n)`.
- **Re-sort on every add:** Time `O(n log n)` per add, Space `O(n)`.

## Key Takeaway

"k-th largest" in a stream = min-heap capped at size `k`; the root is the answer. Mirror it (max-heap of size `k`) for "k-th smallest".
