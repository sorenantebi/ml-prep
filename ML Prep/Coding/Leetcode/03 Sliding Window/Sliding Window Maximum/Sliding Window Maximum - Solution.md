# Sliding Window Maximum - Solution

**Question:** [[Sliding Window Maximum - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Hard

## Intuition

Keep a deque of indices whose values are in **decreasing** order. When a new element arrives, any smaller elements at the back can never be a future maximum (the new one is larger and lives longer), so pop them. The front of the deque is always the current window's maximum; pop it once it slides out of the window.

## Approach

1. Create an empty deque `dq` (stores indices) and result list `res`.
2. For each index `i`:
   - Pop from the back while `nums[dq[-1]] <= nums[i]`, then append `i`.
   - If `dq[0] <= i - k`, pop it from the front (out of window).
   - If `i >= k - 1`, append `nums[dq[0]]` to `res`.
3. Return `res`.

## Code

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque


class Solution:
	def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
		dq = deque()  # indices, values strictly decreasing front -> back
		res = []
		for i, x in enumerate(nums):
			while dq and nums[dq[-1]] <= x:
				dq.pop()  # dominated: smaller and expires sooner
			dq.append(i)
			if dq[0] <= i - k:
				dq.popleft()  # front fell out of the window
			if i >= k - 1:
				res.append(nums[dq[0]])
		return res
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — each index is pushed and popped at most once.
- **Space:** `O(k)` — the deque holds at most `k` indices (output `O(n - k + 1)` not counted).

## Other Approaches

- **Max-heap with lazy deletion:** push `(-value, index)` and pop stale tops — Time `O(n log n)`, Space `O(n)`.
- **Brute force:** compute `max` of each window — Time `O(n * k)`, Space `O(1)` extra.

## Key Takeaway

A monotonic deque gives the max (or min) of every sliding window in amortized `O(1)`: drop dominated elements from the back, expired ones from the front.
