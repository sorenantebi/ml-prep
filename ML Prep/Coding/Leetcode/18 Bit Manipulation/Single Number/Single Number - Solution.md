# Single Number - Solution

**Question:** [[Single Number - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Easy

## Intuition

XOR is commutative and associative, `a ^ a = 0`, and `a ^ 0 = a`. If we XOR every element, each pair cancels to 0 no matter where its two copies appear, and only the unpaired value is left.

## Approach

1. Set `res = 0`.
2. XOR every number into `res`.
3. Return `res`.

## Code

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
	def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
		res = 0
		for num in nums:
			res ^= num  # pairs cancel: a ^ a == 0
		return res
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)`: one pass.
- **Space:** `O(1)`: a single accumulator.

## Other Approaches

- **Hash set toggle:** add a value the first time it is seen and remove it the second time; the one remaining value is the answer. Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)`.
- **Math:** `2 * sum(set(nums)) - sum(nums)`. Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)`.

## Key Takeaway

XOR cancels pairs. Use it whenever values appear an even number of times except one. It also extends to "missing number" and, after splitting by a set bit, to "two single numbers".
