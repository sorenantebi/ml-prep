# House Robber - Solution

**Question:** [[House Robber - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

At each house you either skip it (keep the best total up to the previous house) or take it (best total up to two houses back plus this house). So `best(i) = max(best(i - 1), best(i - 2) + nums[i])`, which only needs two rolling values.

## Approach

1. `prev2 = best up to i - 2`, `prev1 = best up to i - 1`, both 0.
2. For each value `x`: `cur = max(prev1, prev2 + x)`; shift `prev2, prev1 = prev1, cur`.
3. Return `prev1`.

## Code

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
	def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
		prev2, prev1 = 0, 0  # best totals ending two houses back / one house back
		for x in nums:
			prev2, prev1 = prev1, max(prev1, prev2 + x)  # skip x, or take x
		return prev1
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — single pass.
- **Space:** `O(1)` — two variables.

## Other Approaches

- **Memoised recursion:** `f(i) = max(f(i+1), nums[i] + f(i+2))` — Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)`.
- **Brute force:** try all non-adjacent subsets — Time `O(2^n)`, Space `O(n)`.

## Key Takeaway

"Take it or skip it with an adjacency restriction" is the canonical `max(skip, take + dp[i-2])` DP; it reappears in House Robber II, Delete and Earn, and many others.
