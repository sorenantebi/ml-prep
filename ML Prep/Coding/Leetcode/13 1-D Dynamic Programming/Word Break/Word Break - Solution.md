# Word Break - Solution

**Question:** [[Word Break - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

`dp[i]` is true when the prefix `s[:i]` can be segmented. The prefix `s[:i]` is breakable if some dictionary word `w` ends exactly at `i` and the part before it, `s[:i - len(w)]`, is breakable. Since words are at most 20 characters long, we only need to check the matching words, not every split point.

## Approach

1. `dp[0] = True` (empty prefix); the rest `False`.
2. For each `i` from 1 to `n`, for each word `w` in the dictionary: if `len(w) <= i`, `dp[i - len(w)]` is true, and `s[i - len(w):i] == w`, set `dp[i] = True` and stop.
3. Return `dp[n]`.

## Code

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
	def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
		n = len(s)
		dp = [False] * (n + 1)
		dp[0] = True  # empty prefix is trivially segmentable
		for i in range(1, n + 1):
			for w in wordDict:
				start = i - len(w)
				# check the cheap dp lookup before the string comparison
				if start >= 0 and dp[start] and s.startswith(w, start):
					dp[i] = True
					break
		return dp[n]
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n · m · k)` — `n` positions, `m` words, up to `k` (max word length) characters compared each.
- **Space:** `O(n)` — the DP array (word list is input).

## Other Approaches

- **Split-point DP with a word set:** for each `i`, try every `j < i` (or `j >= i - maxLen`) and check `s[j:i] in word_set` — Time `O(n · L^2)` with `L = max word length`, Space `O(n + total dict size)`.
- **Trie + DP / BFS over indices:** walk a trie from each reachable index — Time `O(n · L)`, Space `O(total dict size)`.

## Key Takeaway

Segmentation problems are prefix DPs: `dp[i]` = "can the first `i` characters be built", transitioning on the last piece.
