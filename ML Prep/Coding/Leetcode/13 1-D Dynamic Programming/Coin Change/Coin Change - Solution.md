# Coin Change - Solution

**Question:** [[Coin Change - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

Greedy (largest coin first) fails, e.g. `[1,3,4]` for `6` gives `4+1+1` instead of `3+3`. Instead use unbounded-knapsack DP: `dp[a]` = fewest coins for amount `a`, built bottom-up via `dp[a] = 1 + min(dp[a - c])` over coins `c <= a`.

## Approach

1. `dp = [0] + [INF] * amount`, where `INF = amount + 1` (more coins than could ever be needed, so it means "unreachable").
2. For `a` from 1 to `amount`, for each coin `c <= a`, `dp[a] = min(dp[a], dp[a - c] + 1)`.
3. Return `dp[amount]` if finite, else `-1`.

## Code

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
	def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
		INF = amount + 1  # more coins than could ever be needed
		dp = [0] + [INF] * amount
		for a in range(1, amount + 1):
			for c in coins:
				if c <= a and dp[a - c] + 1 < dp[a]:
					dp[a] = dp[a - c] + 1  # use coin c last
		return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != INF else -1
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(amount · len(coins))` — each amount tries every coin.
- **Space:** `O(amount)` — the DP array.

## Other Approaches

- **BFS over amounts:** each level adds one coin; first time you hit `amount` is the answer — Time `O(amount · len(coins))`, Space `O(amount)`.
- **Memoised recursion:** `f(a) = 1 + min f(a - c)` — same complexity, plus recursion stack.

## Key Takeaway

Minimum-count with unlimited reuse is unbounded knapsack; when greedy looks tempting, test a counterexample like `[1,3,4], 6`.
