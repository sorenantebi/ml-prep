# Pow(x, n) - Solution

**Question:** [[Pow(x, n) - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

Multiplying `x` by itself `n` times is too slow when `|n|` is around 2^31. Binary exponentiation uses `x^n = (x^2)^(n/2)`. Read the bits of `n`: keep squaring the base, and multiply it into the result whenever the current bit is 1. That takes `O(log n)` multiplications. For a negative exponent, use `1/x` as the base and `-n` as the exponent.

## Approach

1. If `n < 0`, set `x = 1 / x` and `n = -n`. Python integers don't overflow, so `-(-2^31)` is safe.
2. Set `res = 1.0`.
3. While `n > 0`: if `n & 1`, multiply `res *= x`; then square `x *= x` and shift `n >>= 1`.
4. Return `res`.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
	def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
		if n < 0:
			x, n = 1 / x, -n
		res = 1.0
		while n:
			if n & 1:  # this bit of the exponent contributes the current power
				res *= x
			x *= x  # x, x^2, x^4, x^8, ...
			n >>= 1
		return res
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(log |n|)`: one loop iteration per bit of `n`.
- **Space:** `O(1)`: iterative, no recursion stack.

## Other Approaches

- **Recursive fast power:** `half = myPow(x, n // 2)`, then return `half * half`, times `x` if `n` is odd. Time `O(log n)`, Space `O(log n)` for the recursion stack.
- **Naive repeated multiplication:** Time `O(|n|)`, Space `O(1)`. Too slow when `|n|` is around 2^31.

## Key Takeaway

Exponentiation by squaring turns `O(n)` repeated work into `O(log n)`. The same idea gives modular power, matrix power (fast Fibonacci), and binary lifting. In languages with fixed-size integers, remember that negating `INT_MIN` overflows.
