# Happy Number - Solution

**Question:** [[Happy Number - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Easy

## Intuition

The "sum of squared digits" map sends any number to a much smaller value (at most `81 * digits`), so the sequence soon stays in a small range and must eventually repeat. That turns the problem into cycle detection on an implicit linked list: either we reach `1` (a fixed point) or we enter a loop. Floyd's tortoise-and-hare finds the loop in `O(1)` space.

## Approach

1. Write `nxt(x)`, which returns the sum of the squares of `x`'s digits.
2. Start with `slow = n` and `fast = nxt(n)`.
3. While `fast != 1` and `slow != fast`, move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps.
4. Return `fast == 1`.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
	def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
		def nxt(x: int) -> int:
			total = 0
			while x:
				x, d = divmod(x, 10)
				total += d * d
			return total

		slow, fast = n, nxt(n)
		# Floyd's cycle detection: 1 is a fixed point (nxt(1) == 1)
		while fast != 1 and slow != fast:
			slow = nxt(slow)
			fast = nxt(nxt(fast))
		return fast == 1
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(log n)`: the first step costs `O(log n)` digits and quickly brings the value below about 243. After that, every step and the cycle length are bounded by a constant.
- **Space:** `O(1)`: only two pointers.

## Other Approaches

- **Hash set of seen values:** keep iterating until you reach `1` or see a value again. Time `O(log n)`, Space `O(log n)` (in practice bounded by a small constant).

## Key Takeaway

When repeatedly applying a function must end in a fixed point or a cycle, treat the values as nodes of a linked list. Use Floyd's fast/slow pointers (or a seen-set) to detect the cycle.
