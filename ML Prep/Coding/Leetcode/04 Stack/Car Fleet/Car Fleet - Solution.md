# Car Fleet - Solution

**Question:** [[Car Fleet - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

Process cars from closest to the target to farthest. Each car's solo arrival time is `(target - position) / speed`. If a car behind would arrive no later than the fleet directly ahead of it, it catches that fleet and merges; otherwise it arrives strictly later and starts a new fleet that becomes the new blocker.

## Approach

1. Pair each position with its speed and sort by position descending.
2. Compute each car's arrival time `(target - p) / s`.
3. Keep a stack of fleet arrival times. For each car, if the stack is empty or its time is greater than the top, push it (new fleet); otherwise it merges into the fleet ahead.
4. Return the stack size.

## Code

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
	def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
		cars = sorted(zip(position, speed), reverse=True)  # closest to target first
		stack = []  # arrival times of fleets, strictly increasing
		for p, s in cars:
			t = (target - p) / s
			# slower than the fleet ahead -> it cannot catch up, new fleet
			if not stack or t > stack[-1]:
				stack.append(t)
		return len(stack)
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n log n)` — dominated by sorting.
- **Space:** `O(n)` — the sorted pairs and the stack.

## Other Approaches

- **Single variable instead of stack:** only the last fleet's time matters, so track `slowest` time and count increments when `t > slowest` — Time `O(n log n)`, Space `O(n)` for sorting (O(1) extra otherwise).

## Key Takeaway

Sort by position and reason from the front: a car's fate depends only on the fleet immediately ahead, compared via arrival times rather than simulating motion.
