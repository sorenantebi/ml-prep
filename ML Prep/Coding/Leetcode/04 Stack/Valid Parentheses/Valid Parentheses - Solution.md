# Valid Parentheses - Solution

**Question:** [[Valid Parentheses - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Easy

## Intuition

The bracket that must be closed next is always the most recently opened one that is still unmatched, so a stack of open brackets models the nesting exactly. Each closing bracket must match the top of the stack.

## Approach

1. Map each closing bracket to its opening partner.
2. Scan the string: push opening brackets onto the stack.
3. For a closing bracket, if the stack is empty or its top is not the matching opener, return `False`; otherwise pop.
4. At the end the string is valid only if the stack is empty (no unclosed openers).

## Code

```python
class Solution:
	def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
		pairs = {")": "(", "]": "[", "}": "{"}
		stack = []
		for ch in s:
			if ch in pairs:
				# closing bracket must match the latest unmatched opener
				if not stack or stack[-1] != pairs[ch]:
					return False
				stack.pop()
			else:
				stack.append(ch)
		return not stack
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — single pass, O(1) work per character.
- **Space:** `O(n)` — the stack can hold every character in the worst case (e.g. all openers).

## Other Approaches

- **Repeated replacement:** keep deleting `"()"`, `"[]"`, `"{}"` substrings until nothing changes; valid iff the string becomes empty — Time `O(n^2)`, Space `O(n)`.

## Key Takeaway

Matching nested pairs = stack. Check for an empty stack both when popping and at the very end.
