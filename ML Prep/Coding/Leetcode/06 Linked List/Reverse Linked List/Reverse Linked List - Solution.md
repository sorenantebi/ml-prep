# Reverse Linked List - Solution

**Question:** [[Reverse Linked List - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Easy

## Intuition

Walking the list once, we can flip each node's `next` pointer to point backwards. The only subtlety is that flipping a pointer loses the link to the rest of the list, so we save `next` before overwriting it. Three pointers (`prev`, `cur`, `nxt`) are enough.

## Approach

1. Set `prev = None` and `cur = head`.
2. While `cur` is not `None`: save `nxt = cur.next`, point `cur.next = prev`, then advance `prev = cur`, `cur = nxt`.
3. When `cur` falls off the end, `prev` is the new head; return it.

## Code

```python
from typing import Optional

# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
	def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
		prev, cur = None, head
		while cur:
			nxt = cur.next      # remember the rest of the list
			cur.next = prev     # flip the pointer
			prev, cur = cur, nxt
		return prev
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — each node is visited once.
- **Space:** `O(1)` — only a few pointers; the list is reversed in place.

## Other Approaches

- **Recursive:** reverse the rest of the list, then set `head.next.next = head` and `head.next = None` — Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)` recursion stack.
- **Stack / array:** push values onto a stack and rebuild — Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)`.

## Key Takeaway

The `prev / cur / nxt` pointer dance is the building block for many linked-list problems (Reorder List, Reverse Linked List II, K-Group reversal) — memorize it.
