# Linked List Cycle - Solution

**Question:** [[Linked List Cycle - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Easy

## Intuition

Floyd's tortoise and hare: move one pointer one step at a time and another two steps at a time. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer reaches the end. If there is a cycle, both pointers end up inside it and the fast one gains one node per step on the slow one, so they must meet.

## Approach

1. Start `slow` and `fast` at `head`.
2. While `fast` and `fast.next` exist: move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps.
3. If they ever point to the same node, return `True`.
4. If the loop exits (end of list reached), return `False`.

## Code

```python
from typing import Optional

# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
	def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
		slow = fast = head
		while fast and fast.next:
			slow = slow.next
			fast = fast.next.next
			if slow is fast:    # compare identity, not values
				return True
		return False
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — the fast pointer either exits in `n/2` steps or catches the slow one within one lap of the cycle.
- **Space:** `O(1)` — two pointers.

## Other Approaches

- **Hash set of visited nodes:** return `True` when a node is seen twice — Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)`.

## Key Takeaway

Fast/slow pointers detect cycles in `O(1)` space; the same idea finds the middle of a list and the cycle start (Linked List Cycle II, Find the Duplicate Number).
