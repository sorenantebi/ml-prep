# Alien Dictionary

**Topic:** [[12 Advanced Graphs|Advanced Graphs]] · **Difficulty:** Hard · [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/) · [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/problems/foreign-dictionary)

**Solve it in:** [[Alien Dictionary]] · **Answer:** [[Alien Dictionary - Solution]]

## Problem

An alien language uses a subset of lowercase English letters, but in an unknown order. You are given a list of `words` that is claimed to be sorted lexicographically according to the alien alphabet.

Return a string containing every unique letter that appears in `words`, arranged in an order consistent with the sorting. If the given ordering is impossible (contradictory), return `""`. If multiple orders are valid, return any of them.

Notes on lexicographic order: the first position where two words differ decides their order; if one word is a prefix of the other, the shorter word must come first (so `["abc", "ab"]` is invalid).

(LeetCode 269 is a premium problem; NeetCode hosts it as "Foreign Dictionary".)

## Examples

**Example 1**
```text
Input: words = ["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]
Output: "wertf"
```

**Example 2**
```text
Input: words = ["z","x"]
Output: "zx"
```

**Example 3**
```text
Input: words = ["z","x","z"]
Output: ""
Explanation: z < x and x < z is a contradiction.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters only.

## Starter Code & Test Cases

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque


def is_valid_order(words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:
	"""True if `order` holds each letter of `words` exactly once and `words` is sorted under it."""
	letters = set("".join(words))
	if len(order) != len(letters) or set(order) != letters:
		return False
	rank = {ch: i for i, ch in enumerate(order)}
	keys = [[rank[ch] for ch in w] for w in words]  # list comparison handles prefixes
	return all(keys[i] <= keys[i + 1] for i in range(len(keys) - 1))


class Solution:
	def alienOrder(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
		pass  # your code here


if __name__ == "__main__":
	s = Solution()
	w = ["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]
	assert is_valid_order(w, s.alienOrder(w))
	assert s.alienOrder(["z","x"]) == "zx"
	assert s.alienOrder(["z","x","z"]) == ""
	assert s.alienOrder(["abc","ab"]) == ""
	assert s.alienOrder(["z"]) == "z"
	w = ["ab","adc"]
	assert is_valid_order(w, s.alienOrder(w))
	w = ["z","z"]
	assert s.alienOrder(w) == "z"
	w = ["ab","abc","b","ba"]
	assert is_valid_order(w, s.alienOrder(w))
	print("All tests passed!")
```
