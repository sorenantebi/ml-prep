# Meeting Rooms II - Solution

**Question:** [[Meeting Rooms II - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

The answer is the maximum number of meetings in progress at the same moment. Sweep through the start times in order while a pointer walks the sorted end times: every start needs a room, and every end that is `<=` the current start has already freed one. The peak of "starts so far minus ends so far" is the room count.

## Approach

1. Sort all start times and all end times separately.
2. Walk the starts with index `i` and the ends with index `j`.
3. If `starts[i] < ends[j]`, a new meeting begins before any room frees: `count += 1`, `i += 1`. Otherwise a meeting has ended: `count -= 1`, `j += 1` (ties process the end first, so back-to-back meetings share a room).
4. Track the maximum `count` and return it.

## Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
	def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
		starts = sorted(s for s, _ in intervals)
		ends = sorted(e for _, e in intervals)
		rooms = best = 0
		i = j = 0
		while i < len(starts):
			if starts[i] < ends[j]:     # meeting starts before the earliest end
				rooms += 1
				i += 1
			else:                       # a room frees up (end <= start)
				rooms -= 1
				j += 1
			best = max(best, rooms)
		return best
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n log n)` — two sorts plus a linear sweep.
- **Space:** `O(n)` — the two sorted arrays.

## Other Approaches

- **Min-heap of end times:** sort by start; pop the heap top if it ended by the current start, then push the current end; the heap's size at the end is the answer — Time `O(n log n)`, Space `O(n)`.
- **Difference map / sweep line:** `+1` at each start, `-1` at each end, sort the keys and track the running maximum — Time `O(n log n)`, Space `O(n)`.

## Key Takeaway

"Minimum resources for overlapping intervals" = maximum overlap depth, computed by a sweep over sorted start/end events (or a min-heap of end times).
