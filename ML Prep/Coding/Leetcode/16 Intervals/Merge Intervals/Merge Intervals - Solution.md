# Merge Intervals - Solution

**Question:** [[Merge Intervals - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

After sorting by start, any interval that overlaps the current merged block must come right after it — an interval can only overlap the last block if its start is `<=` that block's end. So one pass over the sorted list either extends the last block or starts a new one.

## Approach

1. Sort intervals by start.
2. Initialize `res` with the first interval.
3. For each next interval `[s, e]`: if `s <= res[-1][1]`, set `res[-1][1] = max(res[-1][1], e)`; otherwise append `[s, e]`.
4. Return `res`.

## Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
	def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
		intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
		res = [intervals[0][:]]
		for start, end in intervals[1:]:
			if start <= res[-1][1]:                  # overlaps (or touches) last block
				res[-1][1] = max(res[-1][1], end)    # max: block may fully contain it
			else:
				res.append([start, end])
		return res
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n log n)` — dominated by sorting; the merge pass is `O(n)`.
- **Space:** `O(n)` for the output (plus `O(n)` used by Python's sort).

## Other Approaches

- **Sweep over endpoints / counting array:** mark +1 at starts and -1 after ends over the coordinate range and read off covered segments — Time `O(n + V)` where `V` is the value range, Space `O(V)`; fiddly with touching endpoints.
- **Graph of overlapping intervals + connected components:** Time `O(n^2)`, Space `O(n^2)`.

## Key Takeaway

Sort by start, then greedily extend the last merged interval with `max(end)` — the template for most interval problems.
