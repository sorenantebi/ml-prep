## 2. Must-read engineering blogs & posts

These are where "how it actually works in production" knowledge lives - the material interviewers draw practical questions from.

- **Jay Alammar - The Illustrated Transformer** - [jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) - still the fastest way to rebuild your mental model of attention the night before an interview.
- **Lilian Weng - Lil'Log** - [lilianweng.github.io](https://lilianweng.github.io/) - her [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) and [Prompt Engineering](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/) posts are effectively the syllabus for agent and prompting questions.
- **Chip Huyen** - [huyenchip.com](https://huyenchip.com/) - production ML/LLM systems thinking; her posts map almost one-to-one onto AI system design interview rounds.
- **Eugene Yan** - [eugeneyan.com](https://eugeneyan.com/) - [Patterns for Building LLM-based Systems & Products](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/llm-patterns/) is a masterclass in the eval/RAG/guardrail patterns interviewers expect you to know.
- **Hamel Husain** - [hamel.dev](https://hamel.dev/) - his evals writing ([Your AI Product Needs Evals](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/) and follow-ups) is the source for the error-analysis-first eval answers that distinguish strong candidates.
- **Simon Willison** - [simonwillison.net](https://simonwillison.net/) - coined the term prompt injection (see his [prompt injection tag](https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-injection/)) and named [the lethal trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/); the reference for LLM security questions and pragmatic tooling takes.
- **Anthropic engineering** - [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) argues workflows-before-agents (a favourite interviewer stance); [Contextual Retrieval](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/contextual-retrieval) is a concrete, numbers-backed RAG improvement; [Effective context engineering for AI agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) and [Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills) cover context budgets, compaction and progressive disclosure.
- **OpenAI Cookbook** - [developers.openai.com/cookbook](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook) - working code for RAG, evals, function calling, and fine-tuning; good for grounding answers in real API mechanics.

## 3. Courses & hands-on

Interviewers can tell within minutes whether you've built things or only read about them. These close that gap.

- **Andrej Karpathy - Neural Networks: Zero to Hero** - [karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) - build backprop, a language model, and GPT from scratch; the single best preparation for "explain it from first principles" questions.
- **nanoGPT** - [github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) - a readable GPT training loop; if you can walk through this repo, you can survive any transformer-internals grilling.
- **minbpe** - [github.com/karpathy/minbpe](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe) - BPE tokenization from scratch; tokenizer questions ("why do models claim 9.11 > 9.9?") stop being scary after this.
- **fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning** - [course.fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) - the fastest route to solid DL intuition if your foundations are shaky; top-down and code-first.
- **Hugging Face courses** - [huggingface.co/learn](https://huggingface.co/learn) - the LLM/NLP course covers the transformers ecosystem you'll be assumed to know; the [Agents course](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course) is a practical tour of tool use and agent patterns.
- **DeepLearning.AI short courses** - [deeplearning.ai/courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses) - 1-2 hour courses on RAG, evals, agents, and fine-tuning, often taught with the relevant vendor; efficient for patching specific gaps.
- **Eval-focused cohort courses** - Hamel Husain and Shreya Shankar teach a well-known "AI Evals for Engineers" cohort course on Maven; worth knowing the curriculum exists since evals are among the most heavily tested topics in 2026 loops (find it by name on maven.com).

## 4. Books

- **AI Engineering - Chip Huyen (O'Reilly, 2025)** - the closest thing to an official textbook for this interview loop: evals, RAG, fine-tuning decisions, inference optimization, all framed as engineering tradeoffs.
- **Designing Machine Learning Systems - Chip Huyen (O'Reilly, 2022)** - pre-LLM ML systems thinking (data, deployment, monitoring, feedback loops) that still underpins half of system design interviews.
- **Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) - Sebastian Raschka (Manning, 2024)** - implement GPT end-to-end in PyTorch; companion code at [github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch). Ideal for coding-round prep.
- **Hands-On Large Language Models - Jay Alammar & Maarten Grootendorst (O'Reilly, 2024)** - visual, practical coverage of embeddings, transformers, and applications; the quickest read on this list.
- **Deep Learning - Goodfellow, Bengio & Courville (MIT Press, 2016)** - [deeplearningbook.org](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) (free online) - reference-grade foundations; use selectively for optimization/regularization chapters, don't read cover to cover.

## 5. Staying current

Interviews as of 2026 routinely reference things released in the last six months. You need a low-effort pipeline for staying current.

**Newsletters & feeds**
- **Latent Space** - [latent.space](https://www.latent.space/) - popularised the "AI Engineer" label; best signal on what skills the market (and interviewers) currently care about.
- **Interconnects - Nathan Lambert** - [interconnects.ai](https://www.interconnects.ai/) - the best public writing on post-training, RLHF/DPO/GRPO, and reasoning models; directly feeds alignment-question answers.
- **Simon Willison's weblog** - [simonwillison.net](https://simonwillison.net/) - near-daily, pragmatic coverage of new models and tools; his model release notes are perfect interview-day briefings.
- **Ahead of AI - Sebastian Raschka** - [magazine.sebastianraschka.com](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/) - research digests with enough technical depth to actually explain the papers, not just list them.

**Podcasts**
- **Latent Space podcast** - practitioner interviews about building with LLMs; good for absorbing the vocabulary of production AI engineering.
- **Dwarkesh Podcast** - [dwarkesh.com](https://www.dwarkesh.com/) - long-form interviews with researchers (Sutskever, Amodei, Karpathy, et al.); best for research-depth context at frontier-lab interviews.

**Communities**
- **r/LocalLLaMA** - [reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/) - the pulse of the open-weights world: quantization, local serving, and new model release chatter.
- **Hugging Face and EleutherAI Discords** - where practitioners debug training and inference in the open; lurking teaches you real failure modes.

---

## 6. Practice & benchmarking

- **Arena (formerly LMArena, originally Chatbot Arena)** - [arena.ai](https://arena.ai/) - crowdsourced pairwise model battles (Elo-style); know how it works because "how would you compare two models?" is a standard eval question.
- **Hugging Face leaderboard ecosystem** - [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/) - hosts most public leaderboards as Spaces (the original Open LLM Leaderboard is now retired - knowing *why* benchmark saturation and contamination killed it is itself good interview material).
- **SWE-bench** - [swebench.com](https://www.swebench.com/) - agentic coding on real GitHub issues; the reference point for any coding-agent design discussion. The Verified subset is close to saturated at the frontier, so check which variant a quoted score refers to and how much of it is the harness.
- **MTEB leaderboard** - [huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) - where embedding models are compared; check it before answering "which embedding model would you pick?"

> **Caution - leaderboard-driven thinking is a red flag.** Saying "I'd pick whatever tops the leaderboard" signals junior judgment. Public benchmarks suffer contamination, saturation, and distribution mismatch with your task. The strong-candidate answer is always: leaderboards for a shortlist, *your own task-specific evals* for the decision.

---

## 7. Docs worth reading end-to-end

Vendor docs are underrated interview prep - they encode each lab's official position on prompting, tool use, and agents.

- **OpenAI docs** - [developers.openai.com/api/docs](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs) - read the prompting, function calling / tool use, and agents guides; also structured outputs, which comes up constantly in production-integration questions.
- **Anthropic (Claude) docs** - [platform.claude.com/docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs) - the prompt engineering section is the most thorough of any vendor (system prompts, XML structuring, chaining); read the tool use and agent guides too.
- **Google AI (Gemini) docs** - [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev/) - read the long-context and prompting strategy sections; Gemini's 1M+ token context makes it the standard example in "long context vs. RAG" debates.
- **vLLM docs** - [docs.vllm.ai](https://docs.vllm.ai/) - read the pages on PagedAttention, continuous batching, prefix caching, and quantization support; this is exactly the material inference/serving interview rounds are built from.
- **SGLang docs** - [docs.sglang.io](https://docs.sglang.io/) - the main alternative serving engine; skim RadixAttention and structured-output support so you can compare it with vLLM.

---

## 8. Agent protocols and standards

These are the specs behind most 2026 agent-design questions. Read the overview and the security sections, then skim the rest.

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification** - [modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest) - the current revision is dated 2026-07-28, and its changelog (stateless requests with no `initialize` handshake, server-to-client input via multi round-trip requests) is worth reading if you learned MCP on an older version. Know the server primitives (tools, resources, prompts), the client features (sampling, roots, elicitation), the stdio and Streamable HTTP transports, and the authorisation model; MCP is the assumed answer to "how do you standardise tool integration for agents?"
- **Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol specification** - [a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/) - Agent Cards, tasks and their lifecycle, streaming and push notifications; the reference for "how does one agent call another across a company boundary?"
- **Agent Skills** - [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/) - the open format for `SKILL.md` folders and progressive disclosure; read the specification page and the guidance on writing descriptions.
- **AGENTS.md** - [agents.md](https://agents.md/) - the convention for repository-level instructions to coding agents, and the contrast case to on-demand skills.
- **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications** - [genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/) - the shared vocabulary for AI security reviews; know each category well enough to name a mitigation.
- **OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions** - [opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/) - the standard attribute names for LLM and agent spans, useful when an observability question asks how traces stay portable across vendors.
