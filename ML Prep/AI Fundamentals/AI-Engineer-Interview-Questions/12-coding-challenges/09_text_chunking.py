"""Challenge 09 - Text Chunking Strategies (Easy)

PROBLEM
-------
Implement four chunkers used in RAG ingestion pipelines:

    chunk_fixed(text, size) -> list[str]
        Non-overlapping fixed-size chunks. Concatenating the chunks must
        reconstruct the original text exactly.

    chunk_sliding(text, size, overlap) -> list[str]
        Sliding window: each chunk is at most `size` chars and consecutive
        chunks share exactly `overlap` chars (step = size - overlap).
        Every character of the text must be covered. overlap < size required.

    chunk_sentences(text, max_size) -> list[str]
        Split into sentences (on ., !, ? followed by whitespace), then greedily
        pack whole sentences into chunks of at most `max_size` chars. A single
        sentence longer than max_size is hard-split so the invariant holds.

    chunk_recursive(text, max_size, separators=("\n\n", "\n", ". ", "")) -> list[str]
        Recursive splitter (LangChain-style): try the coarsest separator first;
        pieces still over max_size fall through to finer separators, ending
        with a raw character split. Separators stay attached to the preceding
        piece so that "".join(chunks) == text.

All chunkers must return only non-empty chunks and respect their size bound.

INTERVIEW NOTES
---------------
A strong solution demonstrates:
- Treating chunker properties as invariants (coverage, max size, overlap)
  and testing the invariants rather than hard-coding expected chunk lists.
- Correct sliding-window arithmetic: step = size - overlap, and the guard
  overlap < size (step <= 0 loops forever - a classic bug).
- In the recursive splitter, keeping separators attached so no characters are
  silently dropped; naive str.split() loses them and corrupts offsets.
- Knowing WHY each strategy exists: fixed is simple but cuts mid-sentence;
  overlap protects boundary context at the cost of index bloat (size 512 /
  overlap 128 stores ~1.33x the text); sentence/recursive respect semantics.
Common mistakes: dropping the tail chunk, empty-string chunks, off-by-one at
the last window, and recursion that never terminates on separator-free text.
Follow-ups: return (chunk, start_offset) pairs for citation highlighting;
token-based sizes with a real tokenizer (embedding models cap input in
tokens, not characters); semantic chunking via embedding similarity between
adjacent sentences; contextual chunk headers (prepend the document title or
an LLM-written one-line summary of where the chunk sits before embedding);
small-to-big retrieval (match on small chunks, return the parent section).
