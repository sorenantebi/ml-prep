# 🧠 Google DeepMind (and Google AI roles) - AI Engineer Interview Questions

> **Last reviewed: October 2026.** Based only on public information - official pages, engineering blogs, and publicly shared candidate reports. Processes change and vary by team; treat this as a map, not a contract. No confidential or leaked material.

## TL;DR

- Two distinct loops share one brand: **DeepMind proper** (Research Engineer / Research Scientist / Software Engineer) runs a research-flavoured loop with math, ML breadth, and sometimes paper discussion; **Google AI-adjacent SWE-ML roles** run the classic Google loop (algorithmic coding × 2-3, system design, "Googleyness") plus 1-2 ML domain rounds.
- The DeepMind RE loop is famous for **breadth**: publicly reported rounds quiz across CS fundamentals, linear algebra, calculus, probability/statistics, and classical ML + RL - encyclopedic recall matters more here than at most labs.
- Expect at least one **ML coding round where you build a primitive from scratch** (attention, a loss, a sampling routine, a training loop) and where interviewers reportedly expect the code to actually run - no libraries doing the work, no AI assistance (candidate reports describe a strict no-AI-tools policy in technical rounds).
- The **algorithmic coding bar is standard Google**: LeetCode-medium/hard, clean communication, complexity analysis. Clearing coding is often gated before the ML rounds (reported, varies).
- Process is **slow and committee-driven**: recruiter → hiring manager → phone screens → 5-7 round loop → hiring committee. Public reports put end-to-end at roughly 6-10 weeks, longer for research tracks.
- **At least one round is now in person.** Google reinstated mandatory in-person interviewing for hires in 2025, a change publicly backed by Sundar Pichai and explicitly motivated by AI-assisted cheating in virtual technical rounds. Plan travel into your timeline.
- **AI-assisted coding is arriving on the Google side.** From the second half of 2026 Google is piloting a "code comprehension" round for junior and mid-level SWE roles on select US teams: candidates read, debug and optimise an existing codebase with Gemini available, and are scored partly on AI fluency (prompting, output validation, debugging). Public reports do not say the pilot covers DeepMind RE or RS loops, so ask your recruiter which format you will get (reported, varies).

## Company context

Google DeepMind is Google's consolidated frontier-AI unit - the Gemini model family, AlphaFold, AlphaGo/AlphaZero lineage, and the research behind much of Google's AI product surface. Engineers want in because it pairs frontier research with Google-scale compute (TPU fleets) and distribution through Search, Workspace, Android, and Cloud. "AI engineer" there usually means **Research Engineer** - someone who turns research ideas into fast, correct, large-scale code - while the broader Google org hires SWE-ML engineers who build ML-powered products and the serving/eval infrastructure around Gemini.

## Roles & titles they hire

Titles listed publicly on [deepmind.google/careers](https://deepmind.google/careers/) and Google's job board:

- **Research Engineer** (the core "AI engineer" role at DeepMind - bridges research and implementation; no PhD required, strong engineering + ML expected)
- **Research Scientist** (publication-driven; PhD-typical; paper-discussion rounds)
- **Software Engineer** (infrastructure, tooling, serving inside DeepMind - bar comparable to senior Google product teams)
- **Product Manager / Technical Program Manager / Program Manager** (non-IC-eng)
- On the Google side: **Software Engineer III/Senior/Staff, Machine Learning** (SWE-ML), **Machine Learning Engineer**, and AI-focused roles in Cloud AI, Search, and Labs
- **Student Researcher / internships** for early-career research tracks

Note the ladder distinction: DeepMind maintains RE and RS as separate ladders with different loops; SWE at DeepMind is closer to the standard Google SWE loop with domain depth added.

## The interview loop

Public info on the DeepMind RE loop is comparatively good (multiple detailed candidate write-ups and coaching-site guides agree on shape). Confidence: **medium-high** for structure, lower for round-by-round specifics, which vary by team and level. Since 2025, expect at least one stage to be conducted on site rather than virtually (company-wide policy, widely reported).

| Stage | Format | What's evaluated |
|---|---|---|
| Recruiter screen | 30 min call | Background, motivation, ladder/level fit ([official careers page](https://deepmind.google/careers/) describes initial interviews) |
| Hiring manager screen | 30-45 min | Project depth, team fit, research/eng orientation (reported, varies) |
| Technical phone screen(s) | 1-2 × 45-60 min, shared editor | Google-style algorithmic coding, LC medium/hard; clear communication (reported) |
| ML breadth round ("the quiz") | 1-2 back-to-back sessions, rapid-fire | CS fundamentals, linear algebra, calculus, probability/statistics, classical ML, RL basics - breadth over depth (well-documented in public candidate accounts; format may have evolved) |
| ML coding | 60 min | Implement an ML primitive from scratch (loss, attention, sampler, training loop); code expected to run (reported) |
| Systems / design round | 60 min | For RE: distributed training, eval infrastructure; for SWE: standard system design (reported, varies by track) |
| Paper discussion | 60 min | Research-scientist track mostly; sometimes RE - present a paper you know deeply, defend and extend it (reported, varies) |
| Leadership / team lead chats | 1-2 × 30-45 min | Mutual fit, project alignment, collaboration style |
| People & culture | 30-45 min | Values, "Googleyness"-equivalent, mission alignment (safety and responsibility framing is explicit on their careers page) |
| Hiring committee | Async | Packet review; reported to be slower and more research-weighted than standard Google HC |

For **Google SWE-ML** roles the loop is the standard, well-documented Google loop: 2-3 algorithmic coding rounds, 1 system design (ML design for ML-titled roles), 1 Googleyness/behavioural round, then hiring committee and team matching. Junior and mid-level candidates on some US teams may instead meet the AI-assisted code comprehension round piloted from the second half of 2026 (reported, varies).

## What they emphasise

- **Breadth with real fundamentals.** The quiz-style rounds exist to filter for people who genuinely know the math and CS under the ML, not just framework APIs. Being unable to differentiate a simple expression by hand or state Bayes' rule is disqualifying in a way it isn't at product companies.
- **Code that runs, unaided.** Multiple public accounts stress from-scratch ML implementation with no autocomplete or AI tools, and reports describe DeepMind's AI-tool policy in interviews as stricter than peer labs. Google's 2026 AI-assisted pilot targets junior and mid-level SWE loops; nothing public says it has reached DeepMind's from-scratch ML coding rounds.
- **Research taste even for engineers.** REs are expected to read papers, reason about experimental design, and push back on methodology - the hiring committee reportedly weighs research rigor for engineering roles too.
- **Scale engineering.** Distributed training (data/tensor/pipeline parallelism, TPU-mesh thinking), evaluation infrastructure, and performance work are core RE material - DeepMind's stack is publicly JAX-heavy.
- **Mission and responsibility.** The careers page leads with building AI "safely and responsibly"; culture rounds probe why you want frontier AI work and how you handle its stakes.
- **Classic Google collaboration signals** for the Google-side roles: humility, data-driven disagreement, working across teams ("Googleyness").

## Representative questions

*Representative questions synthesised from this company's publicly known focus areas and role descriptions - not leaked questions.*

### 1. You're receiving an unbounded stream of event IDs. Return the k most frequent IDs seen so far, at any point, with bounded memory.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Start with the exact solution: a hashmap of counts plus a size-k min-heap keyed on count gives O(1) amortized updates and O(n log k) to maintain top-k - but the hashmap is O(distinct IDs), which violates bounded memory on an unbounded stream.

For truly bounded memory you must go approximate. Two standard options:

- **Misra-Gries (heavy hitters):** keep m counters; decrement all when a new ID arrives with no free slot. Guarantees finding all items with frequency > n/m using O(m) space; counts are underestimates by at most n/m.
- **Count-Min Sketch + heap:** a d×w array of counters with d hash functions; estimate = min over rows. Space O(d·w), overestimates only, error εn with probability 1−δ for w = ⌈e/ε⌉, d = ⌈ln(1/δ)⌉. Pair with a k-sized heap of candidates to answer top-k queries.

The interview signal is articulating the tradeoff: exact-but-unbounded vs bounded-but-approximate, and choosing based on stated constraints (skewed distributions favour sketches; adversarial streams need the formal guarantees). Mention practical details: sharding the sketch across workers is trivially mergeable (counters add), which matters in distributed settings; decay (sliding window or exponential) if "so far" becomes "recently."

**Follow-ups:** How would you merge sketches from 1,000 workers and what happens to the error bound? How do you handle a rotating window of the last hour?

</details>

### 2. Derive the gradient of cross-entropy loss with softmax inputs, and explain why we fuse them numerically.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

With logits z, softmax p_i = e^{z_i} / Σ_j e^{z_j}, and one-hot target y, the loss is L = −Σ_i y_i log p_i. The key result: **∂L/∂z_i = p_i − y_i**.

Derivation sketch: ∂L/∂z_i = −Σ_k y_k (1/p_k) ∂p_k/∂z_i. The softmax Jacobian is ∂p_k/∂z_i = p_k(δ_{ki} − p_i). Substituting: −Σ_k y_k (δ_{ki} − p_i) = −y_i + p_i Σ_k y_k = p_i − y_i since Σ_k y_k = 1. The elegance - prediction minus target - is why softmax + CE is the canonical pairing: the gradient never saturates the way separate sigmoid+MSE gradients do, and it's linear in the error.

Numerical fusion matters for two reasons. First, computing log(softmax(z)) naively overflows: e^{z_i} for z_i ≈ 90 exceeds float32 range. The log-sum-exp trick subtracts m = max(z): log p_i = (z_i − m) − log Σ_j e^{z_j − m}, which is exact and stable. Second, computing p then log(p) loses precision when p is tiny (log of a denormal); the fused form keeps everything in log space. In bf16/fp16 training this is not optional - frameworks compute CE loss in fp32 from logits for exactly this reason, and large-vocab LMs (256k tokens) sometimes add a z-loss term to keep the log-partition function from drifting.

**Follow-ups:** What changes with label smoothing? Why can the loss for a large-vocabulary LM dominate memory, and what do fused kernels (e.g., chunked CE) do about it?

</details>

### 3. On average, how many fair coin flips until you see two heads in a row? Walk me through it.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Answer: **6**. Set up a Markov chain on progress states. Let E₀ = expected flips remaining with no progress, E₁ = expected flips with one trailing head.

- From S₀: flip once; heads (½) → S₁, tails (½) → S₀. So E₀ = 1 + ½E₁ + ½E₀ ⟹ E₀ = 2 + E₁.
- From S₁: flip once; heads (½) → done, tails (½) → back to S₀. So E₁ = 1 + ½·0 + ½E₀.

Substitute: E₀ = 2 + 1 + ½E₀ ⟹ ½E₀ = 3 ⟹ E₀ = 6.

The instructive contrast: expected flips to see **HT is 4**, not 6, even though both patterns have probability ¼ per two flips. Reason: after failing partway through HH (you had H, got T), you reset to zero progress; failing partway through HT (you had H, got another H) keeps you in the "have H" state. Overlapping self-structure makes HH "harder." This is the same phenomenon behind the general result that E[waiting time] = Σ over pattern self-overlaps of 2^k (Conway's leading-number trick): HH overlaps itself at lengths 1 and 2 → 2 + 4 = 6; HT only at length 2 → 4.

Interviewers use this class of question to check you reason with conditional expectation and state machines rather than pattern-matching to memorised answers - narrate the state setup explicitly.

**Follow-ups:** Expected flips for HHH? How would you estimate this by simulation and how many trials until your estimate's standard error is under 0.01?

</details>

### 4. Explain the SVD and give two places it shows up in modern deep learning.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Any real matrix W (m×n) factors as W = UΣVᵀ: U (m×m) and V (n×n) orthogonal, Σ diagonal with non-negative singular values σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ ... The geometric read: every linear map is a rotation/reflection, an axis-aligned scaling, and another rotation. The Eckart-Young theorem says truncating to the top-r singular values gives the best rank-r approximation in Frobenius and spectral norm - this is the foundation of nearly every low-rank method.

Two concrete appearances:

1. **Low-rank adaptation (LoRA).** Fine-tuning updates ΔW empirically have low "intrinsic rank," so parameterizing ΔW = BA with B (m×r), A (r×n), r ≪ min(m,n) cuts trainable parameters by orders of magnitude (r=16 on a 4096×4096 projection: ~131k params vs 16.8M). SVD is the analysis tool that justifies this and initializes variants that decompose the pretrained weight itself.
2. **Conditioning and training stability.** The condition number σ₁/σ_min of weight matrices and of the input covariance governs gradient-descent convergence; spectral-norm monitoring detects exploding attention logits, and techniques like spectral normalization and μP-style init reason directly about singular-value scales.

Also worth naming: PCA is the SVD of the centred data matrix; pseudo-inverse solutions to least squares (V Σ⁺ Uᵀ) underlie linear-probe evaluations.

**Follow-ups:** Cost of full SVD on a 4096×4096 matrix, and what you'd use instead if you only need the top 10 singular vectors? Why is the spectral norm of a weight matrix relevant to Lipschitz bounds?

</details>

### 5. Implement multi-head self-attention from scratch - no `nn.MultiheadAttention`, and make it causal.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Core things to get right: the √d_k scaling, the head reshape, the causal mask applied *before* softmax, and mask value −inf (not a large negative number in fp16 - use the dtype min or −inf carefully).

```python
import torch, math

def mha(x, Wq, Wk, Wv, Wo, n_heads):
    B, T, D = x.shape
    d = D // n_heads
    def split(W):  # (B,T,D) -> (B,H,T,d)
        return (x @ W).view(B, T, n_heads, d).transpose(1, 2)
    q, k, v = split(Wq), split(Wk), split(Wv)
    att = (q @ k.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(d)      # (B,H,T,T)
    mask = torch.triu(torch.ones(T, T, dtype=torch.bool), diagonal=1)
    att = att.masked_fill(mask, float("-inf"))
    att = torch.softmax(att, dim=-1)
    out = (att @ v).transpose(1, 2).reshape(B, T, D)     # concat heads
    return out @ Wo
```

Narrate the reasoning: scaling by √d_k keeps logit variance ≈1 at init so softmax isn't saturated; without it gradients vanish for large d. Multi-head is a reshape, not H separate matmuls - one fused projection then a view, O(T²·D) compute and O(H·T²) attention-matrix memory, which is the term FlashAttention eliminates by tiling and never materializing the T×T matrix. For inference, mention the KV cache: at decode step t you compute q for one token and attend over cached K,V - turning O(T²) per step into O(T).

Verify by construction: run it, check output shape, and check causality by asserting position 0's output is unchanged when you perturb position 5's input.

**Follow-ups:** Where does dropout conventionally go and why? Modify this for grouped-query attention - what changes and what does it buy at inference?

</details>

### 6. Implement nucleus (top-p) sampling. What failure mode of top-k does it fix?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Top-k fails because the "right" candidate-set size is context-dependent: after "The capital of France is", the distribution is peaked and k=50 admits 49 junk tokens; in open-ended prose the distribution is flat and k=50 may exclude perfectly good continuations. Nucleus sampling adapts the cutoff to the distribution's shape: keep the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability ≥ p.

```python
import torch

def nucleus_sample(logits, p=0.9, temperature=1.0):
    probs = torch.softmax(logits / temperature, dim=-1)
    sorted_probs, idx = torch.sort(probs, descending=True)
    cum = torch.cumsum(sorted_probs, dim=-1)
    # keep tokens until cumulative prob exceeds p; always keep the top token
    cutoff = cum - sorted_probs >= p          # True = drop
    sorted_probs[cutoff] = 0.0
    sorted_probs /= sorted_probs.sum()
    return idx[torch.multinomial(sorted_probs, 1)]
```

Details interviewers probe: the off-by-one (`cum - sorted_probs >= p` keeps the token that crosses the threshold; a naive `cum > p` can drop everything when the top token alone exceeds p), renormalization after masking, and temperature ordering (scale logits before softmax; temperature reshapes the distribution, p then truncates it). Complexity is O(V log V) for the sort; at 256k vocab this is measurable, so production samplers often do top-k pre-filter (k≈few hundred) then top-p inside it.

Also know the neighbours: min-p (threshold relative to max prob) behaves better at high temperature; greedy/beam for closed-form answers; and sampling params interact with eval reproducibility - evals should pin temperature=0 or report variance across seeds.

**Follow-ups:** Why can top-p=1.0, temperature=1.0 still produce degenerate repetition, and what mitigations exist? How do you make sampling reproducible across batch sizes on GPU?

</details>

### 7. Your pretraining loss suddenly diverges at step 300k of a long run. Diagnose and fix it.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Triage in order of likelihood and cost:

1. **Look at the telemetry around the spike.** Gradient-norm curve first: a spike preceding the loss jump points to an optimization event; flat grad norms with loss jump points to data or eval-side bugs. Check per-layer norms - attention-logit growth in late layers is a classic instability signature.
2. **Data.** A bad shard (corrupt encoding, adversarial document, near-duplicate flood) hitting at that step is common. Reproduce: replay the exact batch window from the data-loader checkpoint. Fix: skip the offending window, add validation on ingestion.
3. **Numerics.** fp16 without loss scaling overflows; even bf16 runs hit issues in softmax/logits at scale. Mitigations: bf16 with fp32 master weights and fp32 loss computation, z-loss on the logit partition function, QK-layernorm to bound attention logits.
4. **Optimization.** LR too high for this phase (cosine schedules can still be too hot post-warmup), Adam ε too small, β₂ too high causing stale second moments. Gradient clipping (global norm ~1.0) is the standard guardrail - check whether clipping frequency was rising before the spike.

Recovery playbook, publicly standard for large runs: roll back to the last good checkpoint, skip the suspect data window, optionally lower LR briefly, resume. The senior signal is having a *procedure* - checkpoint hygiene, deterministic data order so incidents are replayable, and dashboards that make the spike diagnosable in minutes rather than a re-run.

**Follow-ups:** Why does deterministic, resumable data ordering matter for this workflow? What would make you choose to restart the run entirely rather than roll back?

</details>

### 8. When would you choose Q-learning over policy gradients, and vice versa?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

**Q-learning** (value-based, off-policy): learns Q(s,a) via the Bellman target r + γ max_a' Q(s',a'). Because it's off-policy, it can learn from replay buffers and stale data - high sample efficiency, which is decisive when environment interaction is expensive. Weaknesses: max over actions makes continuous action spaces awkward (you need discretization or an actor); the "deadly triad" (function approximation + bootstrapping + off-policy) can diverge; overestimation bias needs fixes like double Q-learning.

**Policy gradients** (e.g., REINFORCE → actor-critic → PPO): directly optimize E[R] via ∇J = E[∇log π(a|s)·A(s,a)]. Naturally handle continuous/stochastic actions, converge more stably (you're doing gradient ascent on the true objective, if on-policy), and the policy can be exactly the object you deploy. Weaknesses: on-policy data hunger (every update needs fresh rollouts), high gradient variance requiring baselines/advantage estimation (GAE), and sensitivity to step size - hence trust-region methods and PPO's clipping.

Rules of thumb: discrete actions + cheap simulator + need for replay → DQN-family. Continuous control or when you need a stochastic policy → actor-critic/PPO. Modern practice blends them (SAC is off-policy actor-critic with entropy regularization). Worth knowing for this company: RLHF-style LM post-training uses policy-gradient methods (PPO and critic-free variants such as GRPO) because the "environment" step (generating text, scoring with a reward model) is expensive and the action space is the vocabulary - effectively a huge discrete space handled through the policy itself.

**Follow-ups:** What is the deadly triad, precisely, and which of the three do you give up in each family? Why does PPO clip the importance ratio instead of using a KL penalty alone?

</details>

### 9. Design the training setup for a model that doesn't fit on one accelerator - say 70B parameters on a pod of accelerators.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Start with the memory arithmetic. Adam mixed-precision training costs ≈16 bytes/param (2 weights + 2 grads + 4+4+4 optimizer states/master) → 70B params ≈ 1.1 TB of state before activations. No single device holds that, so you compose parallelism:

- **Data parallelism + state sharding (ZeRO/FSDP):** shard optimizer state, grads, and optionally params across the data-parallel group; all-gather params per layer on demand. Cheap to adopt, communication grows with sharding stage.
- **Tensor (model) parallelism:** split individual matmuls (column/row-parallel) across 4-8 devices with fast interconnect; requires all-reduces inside every layer, so keep it within a node/chip cluster.
- **Pipeline parallelism:** partition layers into stages across nodes; microbatching hides the bubble (bubble fraction ≈ (stages−1)/microbatches, so use ≫stages microbatches).
- **Activation checkpointing** trades ~30% recompute for activation memory.

On TPU-style hardware the framing is a device **mesh** with sharding annotations (JAX/XLA GSPMD): you declare how arrays shard over mesh axes and the compiler inserts collectives - same math, different ergonomics; DeepMind's stack is publicly JAX-based.

Then the reliability layer, which is where engineering interviews go: async checkpointing every N minutes (at this scale a preemption without checkpoints costs real money), deterministic resumable data pipelines, per-host failure detection and job restart, and throughput monitoring in MFU (model FLOPs utilization) - 40-55% MFU is a publicly typical target for dense transformer training. State your batch-size/LR scaling assumptions and how you'd validate the setup with a scaled-down proxy run before burning pod-weeks.

**Follow-ups:** Where does communication become the bottleneck as you scale data parallelism, and what does gradient accumulation change? How would you decide between wider tensor parallelism vs deeper pipeline?

</details>

### 10. Build the evaluation harness for a new frontier model release. What does it need to do?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Treat evals as production software, not scripts. Components:

1. **Versioned, immutable benchmark sets** - every dataset, prompt template, and scorer pinned by hash; a leaderboard number is meaningless if the prompt changed between runs.
2. **Contamination controls** - n-gram/substring overlap checks between eval sets and training data, plus held-out canary strings; report contamination status alongside scores.
3. **Deterministic decode policy** - temperature 0 for pass/fail tasks; for sampled generation, fixed seeds and multiple samples with variance reported. A 500-item eval has a 95% CI of roughly ±4 points at 50% accuracy - a 2-point "win" is noise, so paired tests (McNemar's on per-item outcomes) beat comparing headline numbers.
4. **Scorer validity** - exact-match and code-execution scorers where possible; where LLM-as-judge is unavoidable, calibrate the judge against a human-labelled slice and re-check per model family (judges drift and self-prefer).
5. **Regression gating in CI** - every candidate checkpoint runs a fast smoke suite (minutes) and nightly full suites; capability *and* safety evals (refusals, jailbreak batteries, bias probes) gate promotion.
6. **Traceability** - store raw transcripts, not just scores, so regressions are debuggable; tie every score to model hash + harness hash + data hash.

The scale problem is real: full suites across dozens of benchmarks × checkpoints is a scheduling and caching problem (dedupe identical prompt/model pairs, batch across evals, prioritise by information value). The senior signal: you talk about statistical honesty and reproducibility, not just which benchmarks to run.

**Follow-ups:** How do you detect that a benchmark has saturated or leaked, and what do you do next? How would you eval a model whose main improvement is long-context behaviour?

</details>

### 11. Design the serving system for a multimodal assistant (text + image input, streaming text out) at hundreds of millions of users.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Clarify SLOs first: p95 time-to-first-token (TTFT) under ~1s for interactive chat, streaming at ≥ human reading speed (~10-20 tok/s floor), regional availability, cost per query. Then the architecture:

- **Model tiering and routing.** Serve a small fast model for the bulk of traffic and route hard queries to a large model (Google publicly ships this pattern as Gemini Flash vs Pro tiers). Router can be a lightweight classifier; misroutes are a quality/cost dial.
- **Inference core.** Continuous (in-flight) batching to keep accelerators saturated; paged KV cache so long conversations don't fragment memory; prefix caching for shared system prompts (huge hit rates in assistant traffic); speculative decoding with a draft model for 2-3× decode speedup; quantized weights (int8/fp8) where quality allows.
- **Multimodal path.** Image encoder (ViT-style) runs as a separate stage - often on separate hardware - producing embeddings/tokens that join the text prompt; cache encodings for re-referenced images.
- **Disaggregated prefill/decode.** Prefill is compute-bound, decode is memory-bandwidth-bound; separating them onto different pools improves utilization and isolates TTFT from decode load.
- **Safety and product layer.** Inline safety classifiers on input and streamed output (with the ability to halt a stream), quota/abuse controls, conversation state store keyed to user, and global load balancing with regional model replicas.

Capacity math to volunteer: hundreds of millions of DAU × a few queries/day × ~1k tokens/query lands in the trillions of tokens/day - justify the tiering and caching decisions with that number.

**Follow-ups:** What breaks first as median context length grows 10×? How do you roll out a new model version safely under this traffic (shadow traffic, interleaved evals, rollback)?

</details>

### 12. Tell me about a time you disagreed with a researcher (or tech lead) about priorities, and what happened.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

This is the culture round; at DeepMind and Google generally the evaluated axes are collaboration, intellectual humility, and data-driven disagreement ("Googleyness" on the Google side). Structure as STAR, but the content interviewers listen for:

- **You disagreed on substance, respectfully.** Example shape: a researcher wanted a bespoke experimental fork of the training stack for one paper; you believed the fork would rot and pushed for landing the feature behind a flag in mainline. Present the researcher's position as legitimate - deadline pressure before a conference is real - not as an obstacle.
- **You reduced the disagreement to evidence.** You quantified the cost (past forks took N weeks to reconcile; the flagged path added two days now) and timeboxed a spike to de-risk the mainline approach rather than debating in the abstract.
- **Clean resolution, including the case where you lost.** "Disagree and commit" is explicitly valued: if the decision went the other way, show you executed it wholeheartedly and set a checkpoint to revisit with data - not that you relitigated.
- **Relationship outcome.** The researcher-engineer partnership is the core working unit at a lab; end with how the collaboration got stronger (they brought you in earlier on the next project).

Anti-patterns: villainising the counterpart, "I was right all along" endings, escalating to management as the first move, and conflicts that are really just communication failures you didn't own. Pick a story with genuine technical stakes - evaluation validity, reproducibility, infra debt - because those map directly onto what REs at a lab negotiate weekly.

**Follow-ups:** What would have made you change your mind? Describe a time you were wrong in a technical disagreement - how did you find out?

</details>

### 13. Here is an unfamiliar codebase with a failing test and a slow endpoint, and you may use the AI assistant. Walk me through how you work, and how you decide whether to trust what it tells you.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Use the assistant to read faster, never to decide for you. The Google-side pilot reportedly scores AI fluency as prompting, output validation and debugging, so the signal is visible verification, not how quickly you accept a patch.

1. **Orient before prompting.** Read the entry point, the failing test and its fixture yourself, and state a hypothesis out loud. Then ask narrow questions: "where is this cache invalidated", "list every caller of this function". Narrow questions produce checkable answers; "fix this bug" produces a plausible patch you cannot evaluate.
2. **Reproduce first.** Run the failing test, confirm the failure matches the report, and take a timing baseline for the slow path on a realistic input size. Without a reproduction you cannot tell a fix from a coincidence.
3. **Treat every claim as a lead.** If the assistant says a function has one caller, search for it. If it proposes a fix, read the diff line by line and explain why it is correct before running it. Known failure modes: invented APIs, fixes that pass by weakening the assertion, boundary off-by-ones, and "optimisations" that change semantics, such as reordering a floating-point reduction or removing a copy that guarded against aliasing.
4. **Verify by running.** The failing test passes, neighbouring tests still pass, and you add a test that would have caught the bug. For the performance fix, re-measure against the baseline and state the complexity change rather than "it feels faster".
5. **Say when you overrule it.** One explicit "it suggested X, that is wrong because Y" is worth more than a clean run where the assistant happened to be right.

The anti-patterns are pasting a whole file with "fix it" and going silent while the assistant works. The interviewer is grading your judgement, and they can only grade what you say aloud.

**Follow-ups:** The assistant's fix passes every test but you cannot explain why it works - do you ship it? How would you find the hotspot with the assistant's help if no profiler is available?

## How to prepare

**Repo roadmap, weighted for this loop:**

- [`01-ml-and-dl-foundations`](ML%20Prep/AI%20Fundamentals/AI-Engineer-Interview-Questions/01-ml-and-dl-foundations/README.md) - highest priority. The DeepMind breadth rounds live here: backprop math, optimization, regularization, probability. Go deeper on the math than for any other company in this repo.
- [`02-llm-fundamentals`](ML%20Prep/AI%20Fundamentals/AI-Engineer-Interview-Questions/02-llm-fundamentals/README.md) - attention, tokenization, sampling, scaling: the raw material of the from-scratch ML coding round.
- [`08-inference-and-production`](ML%20Prep/AI%20Fundamentals/AI-Engineer-Interview-Questions/08-inference-and-production/README.md) - KV cache, batching, quantization, speculative decoding for the RE systems round and any Gemini-adjacent SWE role.
- [`11-ai-system-design`](ML%20Prep/AI%20Fundamentals/AI-Engineer-Interview-Questions/11-ai-system-design/README.md) - the design round; practise both training-side (distributed) and serving-side designs. Closest case study currently in this repo: [`11-ai-system-design/case-studies/05-content-moderation-pipeline.md`](05-content-moderation-pipeline.md) - classifier-in-the-request-path design maps directly onto the safety-filter layer of an assistant serving stack.
- Secondary: [`07-evaluation-and-observability`](ML%20Prep/AI%20Fundamentals/AI-Engineer-Interview-Questions/07-evaluation-and-observability/README.md) (eval-infra questions are increasingly common for REs) and [`05-fine-tuning-and-alignment`](ML%20Prep/AI%20Fundamentals/AI-Engineer-Interview-Questions/05-fine-tuning-and-alignment/README.md) (RLHF/post-training literacy).

**Company-specific moves:**

1. **Rebuild ML primitives by hand, offline.** Attention, layernorm, Adam, CE loss, top-p sampling - in a plain editor, no autocomplete, no AI, and run them. This mirrors the reported round format exactly.
2. **Do a real math refresh.** Public candidate accounts (e.g., Aleksa Gordić's write-up) consistently cite linear algebra, calculus, and probability/statistics as make-or-break; *Mathematics for Machine Learning* (Deisenroth et al., free PDF) is the commonly cited text.
3. **Learn JAX basics.** DeepMind's research stack is publicly JAX-based; being fluent in `jit`/`vmap`/`pmap`-style thinking and the mesh/sharding mental model is a differentiator in RE systems conversations.
4. **Read DeepMind's own technical reports** - the Gemini technical reports and AlphaFold papers on [deepmind.google](https://deepmind.google/) - and have one paper (theirs or anyone's) you can present and defend for a potential paper-discussion round.
5. **Grind the classic Google bar too.** LeetCode medium/hard with spoken complexity analysis still gates the loop; don't let lab-flavoured prep crowd out plain algorithms. For the Google SWE-ML path, add one full ML system design mock. Compensation data is publicly tracked on [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/google).
