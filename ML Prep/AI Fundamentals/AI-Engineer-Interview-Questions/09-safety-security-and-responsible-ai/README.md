# 🛡️ Safety, Security & Responsible AI

Every company shipping LLM features now runs a security review, and "how would you stop prompt injection?" has become the AI-engineering equivalent of "how would you prevent SQL injection?" - except the honest answer is harder. This topic shows up in system-design rounds for AI/GenAI engineer roles, in dedicated security loops at frontier labs, and increasingly as a filter question anywhere agents touch real user data: interviewers want engineers who design for failure, not ones who believe a system prompt is a security boundary.

## Crash course

### The root cause: instructions and data share one channel

An LLM's context window has **no privilege separation**. System prompt, user message, retrieved documents, and tool results are all just tokens; instruction-following is a *trained behaviour*, not an enforced boundary. Anything the model reads can steer what it does. Nearly every problem in this topic - injection, leakage, agent hijacking - is a consequence of this one fact, and every defence is an attempt to bolt separation back on from the outside.

### Prompt injection: direct vs indirect

**Direct injection**: the attacker *is* the user ("ignore previous instructions and..."). **Indirect injection**: the attacker plants instructions in content your app will process on someone else's behalf - a web page, an email, a résumé, a PDF, a calendar invite, a tool result. Indirect is the dangerous one: the victim never sees the attack, and it scales (one poisoned page hits every agent that browses it). Simon Willison named "prompt injection" in 2022, and Greshake et al. characterised the indirect variant in 2023. The SQL-injection analogy is apt except there is **no equivalent of parameterised queries**. Training-time mitigations like OpenAI's instruction hierarchy (privileged system > user > tool content) reduce attack success rates but are probabilistic - and in security, a 99% filter just means the attacker iterates until they're in the 1%. **Design assuming injection succeeds.**

### Jailbreaks are a different attack

- **Jailbreak** = attack the *model's safety training* to elicit content the provider forbids. Attacker and victim: the user and the model provider.
- **Prompt injection** = attack the *application* to abuse the user's data and privileges. A third party attacks the user *through* your app.

Jailbreak families, conceptually: **roleplay/persona framing** (fiction wrapper vs. trained refusals), **many-shot** (hundreds of faux dialogue turns exploit in-context learning in long windows - Anthropic, 2024), **encoding/obfuscation** (base64, ciphers, low-resource languages - capability generalises further than safety training), **optimised suffixes** (GCG gradient-searched strings that transfer across models), **multi-turn escalation**, and **best-of-N** random perturbation. Common thread: safety training is distributional; attackers move off-distribution.

### Defence in depth

No single layer works. Stack them and shrink blast radius:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U["User / untrusted content"] --> IF["Input layer:<br/>heuristics + injection classifier<br/>+ moderation model"]
    IF --> LLM["Model<br/>(instruction-hierarchy trained,<br/>untrusted content delimited)"]
    LLM --> OF["Output layer:<br/>moderation + PII scan +<br/>schema validation + URL allowlist"]
    OF --> ACT{"Consequential<br/>action?"}
    ACT -->|"yes"| HITL[Human approval]
    ACT -->|"no"| OUT[Response]
    HITL --> OUT
    OUT --> LOG[("Audit log +<br/>monitoring")]
```

Principles that generate the layers: **least privilege** (minimal tool scopes, read-only defaults), **treat all model output as untrusted** (escape it, parameterise it, sandbox it - it's transitively attacker-controlled), **structural constraints** (a model forced to emit `{"category": one of 5 enums}` can't exfiltrate a secret no matter what's injected), **human approval for irreversible actions**, and **audit logging** for everything.

### The lethal trifecta

Simon Willison's design test for agents. An agent that combines **(1) access to private data**, **(2) exposure to untrusted content**, and **(3) an exfiltration channel** (send email, HTTP fetch, markdown images) is exploitable - full stop. The fix is architectural: **remove one leg**. Gate the exfil channel behind approval, don't feed untrusted content to the privileged agent, or don't give that agent private data. MCP's mix-and-match tool ecosystem makes it easy for *users* to assemble the trifecta by accident.

### Design-level defences

The **dual-LLM pattern** (Willison, 2023): a *privileged* LLM plans and calls tools but never reads untrusted content; a *quarantined* LLM processes untrusted content and returns results only as typed variables (`$email_summary`) the privileged side handles symbolically without reading. **CaMeL** (Google DeepMind, 2025) hardens this into plan-then-execute: the planner writes code from the trusted request alone, a custom interpreter runs it, and capability policies track which data may flow to which sink. Real prompt-injection resistance by construction - at the cost of flexibility (the plan can't adapt to what the data says) and engineering effort. A mid-2025 paper (Beurer-Kellner et al.) catalogues six such patterns: action-selector, plan-then-execute, LLM map-reduce, dual LLM, code-then-execute and context-minimisation. All of them trade capability for one guarantee: untrusted text never gets to choose the agent's next action.

### OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025)

The shared vocabulary of AI security reviews: **LLM01 Prompt Injection**, **LLM02 Sensitive Information Disclosure**, **LLM03 Supply Chain**, **LLM04 Data & Model Poisoning**, **LLM05 Improper Output Handling**, **LLM06 Excessive Agency**, **LLM07 System Prompt Leakage**, **LLM08 Vector & Embedding Weaknesses**, **LLM09 Misinformation**, **LLM10 Unbounded Consumption**. For agent products, 01 + 05 + 06 form the critical chain: injected instructions → unsanitised output → over-privileged tools. In December 2025 the OWASP GenAI Security Project added a separate **Top 10 for Agentic Applications** (ASI01 Agent Goal Hijack through ASI10 Rogue Agents) covering tool misuse, identity and privilege abuse, memory poisoning and inter-agent communication. In an agent review, use both lists.

### Guardrails engineering

- **Input side:** cheap heuristics (regex denylists, length caps) → small injection/jailbreak classifiers (Prompt Guard-style, tens of ms) → moderation (OpenAI's free moderation endpoint; **Llama Guard**-style safeguard LLMs classifying against a hazard taxonomy).
- **Output side:** moderation, PII detection (e.g., Presidio), groundedness checks, **schema validation** - the highest-leverage guardrail because it's deterministic.
- **Latency math:** serial checks add up. Run input classifiers *in parallel* with the main generation and cancel on a hit; for output checks, streaming is the enemy - buffer and check sentence-by-sentence, or stream freely for chat but hard-gate anything that triggers an action. Tier by risk: cheap checks everywhere, expensive checks on triggers.
- Remember guardrail models are themselves attackable, and every classifier has a false-positive budget you pay in product quality.

### Data leakage & privacy

Sensitive data leaks through more paths than the model: **prompts to vendors, observability traces (they store full prompts!), logs, eval sets, fine-tuning data, caches, embeddings**. Controls: API/enterprise tiers don't train on your data by default; **zero-data-retention (ZDR)** agreements remove even the ~30-day abuse-monitoring window; DPAs/BAAs for regulated data. **Assume the system prompt leaks** - extraction is trivial, so no secrets in prompts, ever; keep authorisation server-side. Models also **memorise** training data - extraction attacks have recovered verbatim PII from production models - so dedup and scrub before any training/fine-tuning. Technique stack: **PII redaction pre-LLM** (NER → `[PERSON_1]` placeholders with a reversible map for re-hydration), pseudonymisation, **VPC/private deployment** (Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Vertex) or on-prem open weights for sovereignty, and **per-tenant isolation** - separate vector-index namespaces, ACL filters at query time, never a shared cache across tenants.

### Agent & supply chain security

- **Tools:** least-privilege scopes per task (read-only default, short-lived creds), validated arguments (path roots, URL allowlists, read-only DB users), approval gates for irreversible actions.
- **Code execution:** sandbox (container/gVisor/Firecracker/WASM), **no network egress by default**, resource limits, throwaway filesystems.
- **MCP/third-party tools:** tool *descriptions* enter your context - they're an injection vector (**tool poisoning**); servers can change descriptions after you approved them (**rug pull**) or instruct the model to misuse *other* tools (**shadowing**); a stdio server is arbitrary code on your machine. Pin versions, review descriptions, diff on change, allowlist registries.
- **Identity and memory:** an agent holding broad credentials while acting for a less-privileged user is a **confused deputy** - prefer delegated, user-scoped tokens over a shared service account. Persistent memory turns a one-shot injection into a durable one (**memory poisoning**), so treat memory writes as untrusted input with provenance, review and expiry.
- **Model artifacts:** pickle-based checkpoints execute arbitrary code on load - use **safetensors** (data-only format); PyTorch 2.6 and later default to `torch.load(weights_only=True)`. Pin revisions and verify hashes.

### Alignment, for engineers

Pretraining creates capabilities, including harmful ones. **RLHF** (and DPO/RLAIF successors) shapes the behaviour distribution - helpfulness *and* refusals live in the weights. **Constitutional AI / RLAIF** in one line: the model critiques and revises its own outputs against written principles, then AI preference labels replace human ones for harmlessness during RL. A system prompt merely *conditions* this trained policy; it can't remove a capability and it can be overridden - which is why "alignment via system prompt" is a red-flag phrase. The flip side is **over-refusal**: a model that refuses benign requests is trivially "safe" and useless, so safety evals must always pair harmful-compliance rates with benign-refusal rates.

### Hallucination is a safety problem

Confident fabrication burns users (lawyers have been sanctioned for filing fabricated citations). Mitigations: **grounding** (RAG with instructions to answer only from context), **citations** you actually verify exist in the sources, **abstention** - product flows and prompts that make "I don't know" a first-class answer - and post-hoc groundedness checks. Models hallucinate partly because training and benchmarks reward confident guessing over calibrated uncertainty; product design has to push the other way.

### Red-teaming and safety evals

**Pre-launch:** manual expert red-teaming (security + domain experts) plus automated scanners (garak, PyRIT) and attacker-LLM loops, covering OWASP categories and your app's specific worst-case harms. **Continuous:** re-run on every model swap, prompt change, and new tool - behaviour is not stable across versions. Convert every finding into a regression eval; track attack success rate over time. Know the benchmark names (HarmBench, StrongREJECT, AgentHarm for harmful agent tasks, AgentDojo for prompt injection against tool-using agents, XSTest for over-refusal) and their limits: static benchmarks go stale against adaptive attackers and never cover your domain.

### Responsible-AI process

**Model cards / system cards** document intended use, evals, and limitations (model card = the model; system card = your deployed system). **EU AI Act**: risk tiers - prohibited practices, high-risk (hiring, credit, medical - conformity assessments, logging, human oversight), transparency-tier (chatbots must disclose they're AI), minimal - plus separate obligations for general-purpose models. Prohibitions applied from February 2025 and GPAI obligations from August 2025; the Digital Omnibus deal agreed in May 2026 moved stand-alone (Annex III) high-risk obligations to December 2027 and product-embedded (Annex I) ones to August 2028, so confirm the adopted text before quoting dates. **NIST AI RMF** in one line: a voluntary framework organised as Govern / Map / Measure / Manage, with a Generative AI Profile (NIST AI 600-1) mapping it to LLM risks. **ISO/IEC 42001** is the certifiable AI management-system standard enterprise buyers increasingly ask for. **Audit logging**: immutable records of prompts, outputs, tool calls, and approvals - with the privacy tension (log everything vs. retain nothing) resolved via redacted logs plus restricted raw access.

## Interview questions

See [questions.md](ML%20Prep/AI%20Fundamentals/AI-Engineer-Interview-Questions/09-safety-security-and-responsible-ai/questions.md) - **52 questions** with answers, from injection basics to full secure-agent design.

## Red flags interviewers watch for

- Claiming prompt injection is solved by a system prompt instruction, a delimiter scheme, or "a better prompt" - or not knowing the difference between prompt injection and jailbreaking.
- Proposing to put API keys, credentials, or secret business logic in the system prompt; treating prompt secrecy as a security control.
- Designing an agent with the full lethal trifecta and no approval gates - or never having heard the term and having no equivalent mental model.
- Trusting model output: rendering it as HTML, executing generated SQL/code unsandboxed, or piping it into privileged tools without validation.
- No answer for guardrail latency and false positives - proposing five serial classifier calls on every request without discussing cost, streaming, or FP budget.
- Thinking "we don't train on your data" is the whole privacy story - ignoring logs, traces, retention windows, embeddings, and per-tenant isolation.
- One-time pre-launch red teaming with no regression evals, no monitoring, and no plan for re-testing after model or prompt changes.
- All-safety-no-product answers: unable to discuss over-refusal, guardrail UX cost, or where residual risk is consciously accepted.
