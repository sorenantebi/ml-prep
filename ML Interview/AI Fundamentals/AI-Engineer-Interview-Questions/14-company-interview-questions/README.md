# 🏢 Company Interview Questions

Interview questions, loop maps and prep priorities for 33 companies, tiered from frontier labs to applied AI shops and spanning the US, Europe, China and India, including inference silicon, vertical AI, autonomy and robotics.

Everything here is built from public information: job postings, engineering blogs, technical reports and publicly shared candidate reports. No confidential or leaked material. Processes change and vary by team, so every page carries a "last reviewed" date, marks uncertain stage detail as reported, and lists its sources at the bottom. Treat these as maps, not contracts.

Every page follows the same shape: **TL;DR**, **company context**, **roles and titles they hire**, **the interview loop** stage by stage, **what they emphasise**, around 12 representative questions with worked answers, **how to prepare**, and **sources**.

## How to use this section

1. **Read the TL;DR and the loop map first.** Knowing that a company runs a values round, a take-home, or a solution-architecture presentation changes what you prepare far more than any single question does.
2. **Work the representative questions cold.** Answer out loud before opening the worked answer, the same discipline as the [AI Engineer 75](../AI-ENGINEER-75.md).
3. **Use "what they emphasise" to pick your revision topics.** A serving-heavy company wants [08 Inference](../08-inference-and-production/README.md); a retrieval-heavy one wants [04 RAG](../04-rag-and-retrieval/README.md).
4. **Confirm stage detail with your recruiter.** Loops change quietly, and anything marked "reported, varies" is exactly that.
