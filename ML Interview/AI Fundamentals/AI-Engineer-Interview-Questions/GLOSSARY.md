# 📖 Glossary

Every term this repo uses, defined in one line, with a link to the page that treats it properly. It is a lookup table, not a study guide: use it to unblock yourself mid-question, then read the topic when you have time.

The acronym table below is for scanning when someone drops an initialism you half-recognise. The A to Z after it has the actual definitions.

- **A/B test** - an online experiment splitting users between variants to see which one moves the real product metric. [07 Evals](07-evaluation-and-observability/README.md)

- **ACL filtering** - enforcing per-user permissions inside the retrieval query itself, never by asking the model to withhold results. [04 RAG](04-rag-and-retrieval/README.md)

- **Agent Skills** - an open format for packaging procedural knowledge: a folder holding a `SKILL.md` plus optional scripts, references and assets, loaded by progressive disclosure (name and description at startup, the body when the task matches, bundled files only when needed). [06 Agents](06-agents-and-tool-use/README.md)
- **Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)** - the Linux Foundation body set up in December 2025 to host open agent standards, MCP and AGENTS.md among them. [06 Agents](06-agents-and-tool-use/questions.md)
