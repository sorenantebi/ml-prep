# 🧠 LLM & Transformer Fundamentals

This is the single most heavily tested topic in AI Engineer interviews: every frontier lab, big-tech AI team, and serious startup will probe whether you actually understand what happens inside the model you're building on, or whether you're just calling an API. Expect these questions at every level - screens use them to filter, onsites use them to calibrate depth, and system-design rounds assume this material as vocabulary. If you only have time to master one section of this repo, make it this one.

## Crash course

### The decoder-only transformer, top to bottom

Modern LLMs (GPT, Claude, Llama, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen) are **decoder-only transformers**: a token embedding layer, a stack of N **decoder blocks**, a final norm, and an **LM head** (linear projection to vocab logits, weight-tied to the embedding matrix in many small models, untied in most large ones). Each block does two things - mix information *across positions* (attention) and transform information *at each position* (MLP) - with residual connections around both:

    X["hidden states from previous block (n_tokens × d_model)"] --> N1["RMSNorm"]
    N1 --> ATT["masked multi-head self-attention<br/>Q/K/V projections + RoPE, softmax(QKᵀ/√d_k)V, output proj"]
    ATT --> A1(("＋"))
    X -->|"residual"| A1
    A1 --> N2["RMSNorm"]
    N2 --> MLP["MLP (SwiGLU FFN)<br/>gate and up-project to ~2.7-3.5× d_model, down-project"]
    MLP --> A2(("＋"))
    A1 -->|"residual"| A2
    A2 --> OUT["to next block"]
```

Key design points interviewers probe:

- **Pre-norm vs post-norm.** The 2017 original applied LayerNorm *after* the residual add (post-norm); it trains poorly at depth without careful warmup because gradients must pass through every norm. Modern LLMs use **pre-norm** (norm inside the residual branch, before the sublayer): the residual stream is a clean identity path, gradients flow unimpeded, training is stable at 100+ layers.
- **RMSNorm** (used in Llama-family and most modern models) drops LayerNorm's mean-centring and bias - just rescale by the root-mean-square. Cheaper, equally effective.
- **The residual stream is the model's workspace**: attention and MLPs read from it, write updates into it. This framing (from interpretability work) makes many architecture questions easy to reason about.

### Self-attention in one screen

Each token emits a **query** ("what am I looking for?"), a **key** ("what do I contain?"), and a **value** ("what do I contribute?"). Attention scores are scaled dot products of queries with keys; a row-wise softmax turns them into weights over values.

```python
import numpy as np

def causal_self_attention(X, Wq, Wk, Wv):
    Q, K, V = X @ Wq, X @ Wk, X @ Wv          # each (n, d_k)
    scores = Q @ K.T / np.sqrt(K.shape[-1])    # (n, n); scale keeps softmax un-saturated
    mask = np.triu(np.ones_like(scores, dtype=bool), k=1)
    scores[mask] = -np.inf                     # causal: position i can't see j > i
    w = np.exp(scores - scores.max(-1, keepdims=True))
    w /= w.sum(-1, keepdims=True)              # row-wise softmax
    return w @ V                               # (n, d_k) weighted mix of values
```

- **Why √d_k?** Dot products of random d_k-dim vectors have variance ~d_k. Unscaled, large logits saturate the softmax into a near one-hot, gradients vanish, training destabilises. Dividing by √d_k keeps logit variance ~1.
- **Causal mask** = upper-triangular −∞ before softmax. It's what lets one forward pass over a training sequence produce a next-token prediction loss at *every* position.

### Heads: MHA → MQA → GQA

**Multi-head attention** splits d_model into h heads (e.g. 32 heads × 128 dims), each with its own Q/K/V projections, run in parallel and concatenated. Multiple heads let the model attend to different relations simultaneously (syntax here, coreference there) - one big head would average them into mush. Same total FLOPs as one full-width head.

The pressure that reshaped attention is the **KV cache** (below): its size scales with the number of KV heads.

- **MQA (multi-query)**: all query heads share *one* K/V head → cache shrinks ~h×, some quality loss.
- **GQA (grouped-query)**: groups of query heads share a KV head (e.g. 64 query heads, 8 KV heads) → ~8× cache reduction at near-MHA quality. The modern default (Llama 2/3 70B, Mistral, most 2024+ models).
- **MLA (multi-head latent attention, DeepSeek-V2/V3, also used by Kimi K2)**: cache one low-rank latent vector per token per layer and up-project it to per-head K/V at attention time, cutting the cache below GQA levels while keeping per-head keys and values distinct.

### KV cache

During autoregressive generation, every past token's K and V vectors per layer are reused at each step. Caching them turns per-token cost from O(n²) recompute into O(n) lookups - this is why generation is feasible at all. What you pay is memory:

```
KV bytes per token = 2 (K and V) × n_layers × n_kv_heads × head_dim × bytes_per_elem
```

Example, a Llama-3-70B-shaped model (80 layers, 8 KV heads via GQA, head_dim 128, fp16): 2 × 80 × 8 × 128 × 2 ≈ **320 KB/token** → ~40 GB for a single 128k-token sequence. With full MHA (64 KV heads) it would be 8× that. This is why GQA, MLA, cache quantization, and paged allocation (vLLM's PagedAttention) exist, and why long-context serving is a memory problem, not a FLOPs problem.

### Attention cost and FlashAttention

Attention computes an n×n score matrix: **O(n²) time and (naively) memory** in sequence length. Consequences: prefill cost grows quadratically with prompt length; long-context serving is dominated by KV cache memory bandwidth at decode time.

**FlashAttention** doesn't approximate anything - it's an **IO-aware exact** implementation. Insight: on a GPU, attention is bottlenecked by reads/writes to HBM, not FLOPs. So: **tile** Q/K/V into blocks that fit in on-chip SRAM, compute attention block-by-block with an **online (streaming) softmax** that maintains running max and normalizer, and **never materialise the n×n matrix** (recompute it in the backward pass). Result: exact attention with O(n) memory and large wall-clock speedups. It's standard in every serving stack.

### Beyond full attention

Full attention in every layer is no longer a given. Four variations come up in interviews:

- **Sliding-window (local) attention**: each token sees only the last w tokens, so that layer's KV cache is capped at w. Hybrid local/global stacks interleave many local layers with a few full-attention ones (Gemma 3: five 1024-token local layers per global layer, gpt-oss alternates banded-window and dense layers).
- **Attention sinks**: softmax has to put its probability mass somewhere, so models learn to dump attention on the first few tokens. Evict those from a rolling cache and quality collapses, which is why streaming caches keep them pinned (and why some models, gpt-oss included, add an explicit learned sink).
- **Learned sparse attention**: a cheap indexer scores past positions and each query attends only to the top ones (DeepSeek-V3.2's DeepSeek Sparse Attention).
- **Hybrid linear/SSM stacks**: most layers carry a fixed-size recurrent state (Mamba-style or linear attention) and roughly one layer in every 4 to 10 keeps full attention for exact recall (Jamba, Nemotron-H, Qwen3-Next, Kimi Linear).

The common thread: a few exact layers do long-range retrieval, many cheap layers do the bulk of the work, and only a fraction of the stack has a cache that grows with context.

### Positional information

Attention is permutation-invariant - position must be injected.

- **Sinusoidal** (original transformer): fixed sin/cos of geometrically spaced frequencies added to embeddings. No learned params.
- **Learned absolute** (GPT-2, BERT): an embedding per position index. Simple, but hard-capped at trained length.
- **RoPE** (rotary, the modern default - Llama, Qwen, most open models): instead of adding position vectors, *rotate* each 2D pair of Q/K dimensions by an angle proportional to position, with per-pair frequencies. The dot product between a query at position m and key at position n then depends only on **m − n**: relative position, encoded multiplicatively, no extra params. Some recent models interleave RoPE layers with **NoPE** layers that use no positional encoding at all (Llama 4's iRoPE) to help length generalisation.
- **ALiBi**: no position embeddings at all; add a linear penalty −slope·|i−j| to attention scores (per-head slopes). Biases toward recency, extrapolates to longer sequences than trained.
- **Context extension**: naively running RoPE past trained length fails (unseen rotation angles). **Position interpolation** rescales positions to fit inside the trained range plus a short fine-tune; **YaRN** interpolates frequency bands unevenly (preserve high-frequency/local resolution, interpolate low-frequency) with an attention-temperature tweak - much less fine-tuning needed. The other standard lever is raising RoPE's base frequency θ during long-context continued pretraining (Llama 3 uses 500,000 versus the original 10,000). These are how 8k-trained models became 128k+ models.

### Tokenization

Models see **token IDs**, not characters. Subwords are the compromise between word-level (huge vocab, OOV problem) and character-level (sequences too long, O(n²) attention makes that expensive).

- **BPE**: start from bytes/characters, repeatedly merge the most frequent adjacent pair into a new token until vocab size is reached. Merges are learned once; at inference they're applied deterministically.
- **Byte-level BPE** (GPT-2 onward): base alphabet is 256 bytes → *no* out-of-vocabulary strings, ever.
- **WordPiece** (BERT): like BPE but merges the pair that maximises training-data likelihood, not raw frequency.
- **SentencePiece**: a library (implementing BPE or unigram-LM) that treats raw text as a stream - spaces become a meta-symbol (▁) - so it's language-agnostic and needs no pre-tokenization; widely used in multilingual and open models (T5, Llama 2, Gemma), though Llama 3 moved to a tiktoken-style byte-level BPE.

**Why classic failures are tokenizer failures:** "strawberry" is two or three tokens (e.g. "str" + "aw" + "berry") - the model never sees its letters, so counting r's requires memorised spelling knowledge, not perception. Arithmetic suffers when numbers chunk inconsistently ("1234" vs "12"+"34"), which is why many tokenizers now split digits individually or into fixed groups of three. Non-Latin-script languages fragment into many more tokens per sentence → higher cost, less effective context, worse quality. Code models depend on whitespace-run tokens for indentation. **Vocab size tradeoff**: bigger vocab (Llama 2's 32k → Llama 3's 128k → ~200k in OpenAI's o200k tokenizer and ~262k in Gemma 3) = fewer tokens per text (cheaper, longer effective context) but a larger embedding matrix and rarer, under-trained tail tokens (glitch-token failure modes).

### Architectures and objectives

- **Encoder-only** (BERT): bidirectional attention, **masked-LM** objective. Great at understanding/embedding/classification; can't generate. Lives on in embedding & reranker models.
- **Decoder-only** (GPT/Llama/Claude): causal attention, **next-token prediction**. Every position yields a training signal, generation is native, and one architecture scales to everything - which is why it won.
- **Encoder-decoder** (T5, and speech/translation models like Whisper): encoder reads input bidirectionally, decoder generates with cross-attention. Still strong for fixed input→output transforms.

### The training pipeline

1. **Pretraining**: next-token prediction on trillions of tokens of web/code/books data. Produces a raw completion model - capable, not steerable.
2. **Mid-training / continued pretraining**: high-quality curated data, domain injection (code, math), context-length extension, data-mix annealing toward instruction-like formats.
3. **SFT**: supervised fine-tuning on (prompt, response) demonstrations → follows instructions, adopts chat format.
4. **Preference optimisation and RL**: RLHF with a learned reward model (PPO), offline direct methods (**DPO**, which needs no reward model or rollouts), and RL on *verifiable* rewards (**RLVR**, typically with GRPO-family algorithms - math answers, passing tests), which is what trains reasoning models. Aligns behaviour with preferences and sharpens capabilities SFT can't reach.

### Scaling laws

**Kaplan et al. (2020)**: loss falls as a power law in compute; implied you should grow *parameters* much faster than data. **Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022)** corrected this: compute-optimal training scales params and tokens roughly equally, ~**20 tokens per parameter** (Chinchilla-70B on 1.4T tokens beat Gopher-280B on 300B). But compute-optimal ≠ deployment-optimal: **training cost is paid once, inference forever**, so modern models train far past Chinchilla (Llama 3 8B saw ~15T tokens ≈ ~1,900 tokens/param) to buy a smaller, cheaper-to-serve model at the same quality. **Emergent abilities** (sharp capability jumps with scale) are partly a measurement artefact - the "mirage" critique shows smooth improvement under continuous metrics - but the practical experience of thresholds remains real for discontinuous tasks.

### Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)

Replace each MLP with E expert MLPs plus a learned **router** that sends each token to the top-k experts (e.g. Mixtral: 8 experts, top-2, ~47B total / ~13B active params; DeepSeek-V3: 671B total / ~37B active). You buy **more capacity per FLOP**: quality of a much larger dense model at a fraction of the compute per token, which is why MoE is now the norm for frontier-scale open-weight models (DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-235B-A22B, Kimi K2 at ~1T total / 32B active, gpt-oss). The current recipe is **fine-grained** experts plus an always-on **shared expert** (DeepSeek-V3: 256 routed experts, top-8, plus one shared). Costs: routing must be **load-balanced** (auxiliary losses, router z-loss, or DeepSeek-V3's auxiliary-loss-free per-expert bias) or experts collapse; training is less stable; and at inference **all experts must sit in memory** - you pay memory for total params, FLOPs for active params, so MoE favours large, batched, memory-rich serving over single-GPU deployment.

### Decoding & sampling

The model outputs logits z; sampling shapes them. **Temperature** rescales before softmax: p_i = exp(z_i/T) / Σ_j exp(z_j/T). T→0 is greedy (argmax); T>1 flattens. **Top-k** keeps the k highest tokens; **top-p (nucleus)** keeps the smallest set with cumulative probability ≥ p (adapts to confidence); **min-p** keeps tokens with p ≥ min_p × p_max (adapts even better at high temperature). **Repetition/frequency/presence penalties** damp loops. **Beam search** maximises sequence likelihood - good for translation/ASR, degenerate (repetitive, bland) for open-ended generation. **Logprobs** are your tool for confidence scoring, classification, perplexity evals, and hallucination heuristics - but check the endpoint: many hosted reasoning models fix temperature and top-p and return no logprobs, and some providers expose no logprobs on any model. Confirm support before designing around them, or self-host when you need them.

**Speculative decoding** speeds up generation without changing the output distribution: a cheap draft (a small model, extra prediction heads, or the model's own multi-token-prediction head) proposes several tokens, the target model verifies them in one forward pass, and a rejection-sampling rule accepts a prefix so the final distribution is exactly the target model's. It pays off because decode is memory-bandwidth bound, so verifying k tokens costs about the same as generating one.

### Long context, hallucination, reasoning models

- **Long context ≠ retrieval.** "Lost in the middle": accuracy on facts placed mid-context is systematically worse than at the start/end. A 1M-token window is not a database; RAG and context curation still matter.
- **Hallucination** is structural: the objective rewards plausible next tokens, not truth, and standard training/evals reward guessing over calibrated abstention. Mitigations: grounding (RAG + citations), tool use, abstention training, logprob/self-consistency confidence signals, verification layers - reduction, not elimination.
- **Reasoning models** (the lineage that started with OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1) are trained with RL on verifiable rewards to emit long chains of thought, converting **test-time compute** into accuracy on math/code/planning. Most frontier models now ship reasoning as a mode on the same model, controlled by a thinking budget or reasoning-effort setting, rather than as a separate model. Tradeoff: often several to tens of times more output tokens, higher latency and cost. Spend reasoning on hard multi-step problems; turn it down or off for extraction, classification, and latency-sensitive paths. **Distillation** (training a small model on a large model's outputs or logits) is how reasoning behaviour gets compressed into cheap models.

## Interview questions

**[questions.md](questions.md)** - 65 questions with answers: 13 basic, 16 intermediate, 12 advanced.

## Red flags interviewers watch for

- Can't write or even sketch scaled dot-product attention, or hand-waves Q/K/V as "magic vectors" with no functional story of what each does.
- Says the √d_k division is "for normalization" without connecting it to softmax saturation and gradient flow.
- Believes FlashAttention is an approximation or "sparse attention" - it's exact; the win is IO, not fewer FLOPs.
- Explains the KV cache but can't estimate its size, or doesn't know why GQA/MQA exist - a sign of never having thought about serving.
- Blames "strawberry"-style failures on model stupidity rather than tokenization; more broadly, has never looked at how text actually tokenizes.
- Quotes "Chinchilla-optimal = 20 tokens/param" as a law for what to do, missing that inference economics push training far beyond it.
- Thinks a bigger context window removes the need for retrieval, or that advertised context length equals usable recall.
- Reaches for a reasoning model (or high temperature, or beam search) reflexively without articulating the cost/latency/quality tradeoff.
