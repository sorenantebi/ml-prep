# Case Study 01: Enterprise RAG Assistant

> "Design a company-wide knowledge assistant. Employees should be able to ask questions and get accurate, cited answers from our wikis, docs, tickets, and Slack - without ever seeing content they don't have access to."

## Problem statement

A 20,000-person company has knowledge scattered across Confluence, Google Drive, Notion, Jira, Zendesk, and Slack. Employees waste time searching six tools or interrupting experts. Build an internal assistant that answers natural-language questions with citations, respects per-document permissions exactly, and stays fresh as content changes.

## Clarifying questions & assumptions

Questions I'd ask the interviewer, with the assumptions I'll proceed on:

| Question | Assumption |
|---|---|
| How many employees and how chatty are they? | 20k employees; ~30% weekly active; **~30k queries/day**, peak ~10 QPS |
| Corpus size and churn? | ~4M source documents (~15M after chunking); ~1-2% of docs change daily |
| How strict are permissions? | Hard requirement: a user must **never** see content (even a snippet or citation title) they can't open in the source system |
| Freshness SLA? | Edits visible within ~15 min; deletions/permission revocations within ~5 min |
| Latency expectations? | Chat UX: p95 time-to-first-token < 2s, full answer < 15s, streaming |
| Buy vs build? | Assume build (interview framing), external model APIs allowed if no training on our data |
| What does success look like? | ≥85% answer accuracy on a golden set, ≥40% of users returning weekly, measurable reduction in internal support tickets |

The permission question is the one that changes the architecture most - always ask it first for enterprise RAG.

## Requirements

### Functional
- Ask questions in chat; get streamed answers with **inline citations linking to source documents**.
- Multi-turn: follow-up questions resolve against conversation context.
- Federated ingestion from ≥6 source systems via connectors.
- Per-user permission enforcement identical to source-system ACLs (users, groups, sharing links).
- Feedback: thumbs up/down + "wrong/outdated source" flag on every answer.
- Admin: source-connector health, index stats, eval dashboards, content exclusion rules.

### Non-functional
- **Scale**: 30k queries/day, peak 10 QPS (bursty 9-11am), 15M chunks indexed, 150-300k chunk updates/day.
- **Latency**: p95 TTFT < 2s; retrieval stage < 500ms; p99 end-to-end < 25s.
- **Freshness**: content edits ≤ 15 min; **ACL revocations ≤ 5 min** (security-critical, tighter than content).
- **Quality**: ≥85% correct-and-faithful on golden set; ≥95% of factual claims backed by a retrievable citation.
- **Cost**: target < $0.05/query blended; < ~$50k/month all-in at this scale.
- **Compliance**: SOC 2 posture; no training on company data; full audit log of who asked what and what was retrieved.

## Component deep-dives

### Connectors & ingestion pipeline

- One connector per source system, doing three jobs: **content sync** (initial crawl + webhooks/change feeds + periodic reconciliation crawl for missed events), **ACL sync**, and **deletion propagation**.
- Normalise everything to a common document model: `{doc_id, source, url, title, body, author, updated_at, acl: {allowed_users, allowed_groups, link_sharing}, labels}`.
- Ingestion is queue-backed (Kafka/SQS) with per-source rate limiting - Confluence and Jira APIs will throttle you long before your pipeline is the bottleneck.
- Two priority lanes: a **fast lane for deletions and ACL changes** (target < 5 min end-to-end) and a normal lane for content updates. Never let a backfill starve revocations.
- Tradeoff: webhooks are fresh but unreliable (dropped events, missed subscriptions); polling is reliable but slow and API-expensive. Do both - webhooks for latency, nightly reconciliation for correctness.

### Chunking & embedding

- Structure-aware chunking: split on headings/sections, ~300-800 tokens per chunk with ~10-15% overlap; keep tables intact; prepend a breadcrumb header (`Space > Page > Section`) to each chunk so it's self-describing.

| Source | Chunking approach | Typical chunk size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wiki pages | Heading-based sections | 300-800 tokens | Breadcrumb prefix; tables kept whole |
| Google Docs | Heading + paragraph groups | 300-600 | Strip comments/suggestions |
| Jira/Zendesk tickets | Whole ticket or issue+top comments | 200-1,000 | Status/date in metadata; downweight closed-stale |
| Slack | Thread-level aggregation | 200-800 | Skip channels < N members by policy; authority downweight |
| PDFs/slides | Layout-aware parse, per-section | 300-800 | OCR fallback; figures get caption text |

- Store chunk → parent-document mapping so we can do **small-to-big retrieval**: match on the chunk, optionally feed the surrounding section to the model for better context.
- Embeddings: a strong off-the-shelf embedding model; 15M chunks × ~500 tokens = ~7.5B tokens for a full re-embed. Batchable, cheap relative to query-time costs (math below). Version-pin the embedding model; a model swap means a full re-index, so run **blue/green indexes** for that.
- Tickets and Slack need different handling: thread-level aggregation (a lone Slack message is useless), and an authority downweight - a wiki page should usually outrank a two-year-old Slack guess.

### ACL enforcement (the make-or-break component)

- **Filter at retrieval time, before ranking** - every index query carries the user's permission context; the index only returns chunks the user can read. Post-filtering after retrieval leaks information through ranking behaviour and breaks top-k (you retrieve 10, filter to 2).
- Mechanics: each chunk carries `allowed_principals` (user IDs + group IDs, flattened). At query time, expand the user to their principal set (user + all transitive groups, cached ~5-15 min in the identity graph service) and filter with a terms match. Both OpenSearch-style engines and modern vector DBs handle metadata filters at reasonable scale; verify filtered-ANN recall doesn't crater when filters are highly selective.

```python
def retrieve(user, query_text, query_vec, k=50):
    principals = identity_graph.expand(user)   # user + transitive groups, cached ~10 min
    flt = {"allowed_principals": {"any_of": principals}}
    dense = vector_index.search(query_vec, k=k, filter=flt)    # filter INSIDE the ANN search,
    sparse = bm25_index.search(query_text, k=k, filter=flt)    # never after top-k
    return rrf_fuse(dense, sparse)
```
- **Late-binding recheck**: before rendering citations, re-verify the top documents against the live source ACL (or a seconds-fresh cache) - this closes the gap between revocation and index update.
- Group explosion: a doc shared with "all-engineering" (8k members) stores the group ID, not 8k user IDs; expansion happens on the query side.
- Tradeoff: strict ACLs mean two users asking the same question get different answers - this breaks naive response caching. Cache per-permission-set (hash of the sorted principal set), or only cache within a user session.

### Hybrid retrieval & reranking

- **BM25 + dense, fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**. BM25 wins on exact identifiers ("error `AUTH_407`", "project Falcon Q3"), dense wins on paraphrase ("how do I get reimbursed" → "expense policy"). Enterprise queries are full of jargon and IDs - pure dense retrieval measurably underperforms here.
- Query pipeline before retrieval: conversational **query rewrite** (resolve "what about for contractors?" using chat history - small fast model, ~200ms), optional decomposition for multi-part questions, and metadata extraction (source/date hints → filters).
- Retrieve top ~50 hybrid → **cross-encoder reranker** → top 6-10 chunks into context. Reranking is the highest-ROI quality step in most RAG systems: often a double-digit gain in precision@k/nDCG for ~50-100ms of added latency.
- Recency prior: boost recently updated docs for policy-type queries; the "correct" answer to "what's the travel policy" is the newest one.

### Generation & citations

- Context builder assembles: system prompt (grounding rules, refusal policy, citation format) + top chunks with IDs + conversation history, under a ~12-16k token budget. Put the strongest chunks first: current models are much less position-sensitive at ~7k tokens than the 2023 "lost in the middle" results suggest, but ordering by relevance costs nothing and still helps weaker, cheaper tiers.
- Prompt contract: *answer only from provided context; every factual claim cites `[chunk_id]`; if context is insufficient, say so and name what's missing*. A grounded "I don't know" is a success mode, not a failure - say this explicitly in the interview.
- **Citation verifier** post-step: check every cited chunk_id exists in the retrieved set (catches hallucinated citations cheaply); optionally run a small-model entailment check that each claim is supported by its cited chunk - run async and sampled if latency-sensitive, inline for high-stakes surfaces.
- Model tiering: default to a mid-tier model (most Q&A doesn't need frontier reasoning); route to a frontier model on signals like multi-document synthesis, long context, or a retry-after-thumbs-down.

### Multi-turn handling

- Conversation state lives server-side keyed by session; each turn's context = rewritten standalone query + last N turns verbatim + compacted summary of older turns (small model, offline).
- The **query rewrite step is what makes multi-turn RAG work**: "does that apply to interns?" retrieves nothing; the rewritten "does the remote-work policy apply to interns?" does. Evaluate the rewriter separately (rewrite-accuracy on a labelled multi-turn set) - it's a common silent failure point.
- Retrieval runs fresh every turn; never reuse the previous turn's chunks blindly (the follow-up usually needs different documents).
- Session TTL ~24h; users can pin/share conversations, which makes conversations themselves permission-scoped artifacts (shared conversation must re-check the *viewer's* ACLs before rendering citations - a subtle leak path worth naming).

## Data & context strategy

- **RAG, not fine-tuning, for knowledge** - corpus churns 1-2% daily and is permission-bound; fine-tuned weights can't enforce per-user ACLs and go stale immediately. This is the canonical "why RAG" scenario; state it crisply.
- Fine-tuning only appears later, if at all: possibly a small fine-tuned query-rewriter or a distilled reranker once we have traffic data.
- Context budget per query: ~500-token system prompt + ~8 chunks × ~600 tokens (breadcrumb headers included) ≈ 4-5k + history ≈ 1-2k → **~6-8k input tokens typical**.
- **Provider prompt caching** discounts cached prefix tokens heavily (roughly 50-90% depending on provider), but most providers only cache prefixes above a minimum length, on the order of 1k tokens. A bare 500-token system prompt may not qualify, so put the citation rules, refusal policy and few-shot examples in one stable prefix, and in multi-turn sessions keep earlier turns ahead of the freshly retrieved chunks so they stay cacheable. Even then the cacheable share is small here, because retrieved chunks change every turn.
- Corpus hygiene beats model cleverness: dedupe near-identical pages, exclude archived spaces by default, let admins blocklist known-bad content. Most "the AI is wrong" reports trace back to the corpus containing two contradictory pages.
- Structured sources (Jira, HR systems) may be better served by **tools** (live API lookup) than by indexing snapshots - mention this as a v2 direction rather than complicating v1.

## Evaluation plan

**Offline, component-level (run in CI on every prompt/retrieval/model change):**
- *Retrieval*: golden set of ~300-500 (query → relevant doc IDs) pairs, built from search logs + expert labelling. Metrics: recall@10, nDCG@10, MRR. Evaluate retrieval separately from generation - otherwise you can't tell which stage failed.
- *End-to-end*: ~300 (question → reference answer + required citations) pairs across departments and difficulty tiers, including **unanswerable questions** (correct behaviour: refuse) and **permission-trap questions** (correct behaviour: no leak - this is a hard security test, gate releases on 100%).
- *Judging*: LLM-as-judge with a rubric scoring correctness, faithfulness-to-citations, and completeness; calibrate the judge against ~100 human-labelled examples and report agreement (target ≥ ~85% agreement before trusting it).

**Online:**
- Thumbs up/down rate, "outdated source" flags, citation click-through (are people verifying?), session follow-up rate (immediate rephrase ≈ failure signal), weekly retention.
- A/B test retrieval and prompt changes on real traffic; sample 1-2% of traces (with consent/policy sign-off) into a labelling queue that continuously grows the golden set.

**Metric summary:**

| Layer | Metric | Target | Cadence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Retrieval | recall@10 on golden set | ≥ 0.9 | Every CI run |
| Retrieval | nDCG@10 | track trend | Every CI run |
| Answer | correctness (judge, calibrated) | ≥ 85% | Every CI run |
| Answer | faithfulness-to-citations | ≥ 95% | Every CI run |
| Security | permission-trap leak rate | 0 (hard gate) | Every CI run |
| Online | thumbs-up rate | ≥ 80% of rated | Daily dashboard |
| Online | citation click-through | track trend | Weekly |
| Online | weekly active users retention | ≥ 40% | Weekly |
| Ops | freshness lag per connector | ≤ 15 min p95 | Real-time alerting |

**Quality flywheel**: traces + feedback → new eval cases → fix (usually retrieval or corpus, sometimes prompt) → CI proves no regression → ship. Saying this loop out loud is worth more than any single metric.

## Cost estimate

Illustrative token math with assumed ~prices (state your assumptions; exact prices change):

| Item | Math | ~Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Generation input | 30k q/day × 7k tokens × ~$3/M (frontier-mid tier) | ~$630/day |
| - with prompt caching + 70% mid-tier routing (~$0.5/M) | blended ~$1.2/M effective | ~$250/day |
| Generation output | 30k × 400 tokens × ~$10/M blended (conservative: a 70/30 mid/frontier split is closer to ~$6/M) | ~$70-120/day |
| Query rewrite + rerank (small models) | 30k × ~1.5k tokens × ~$0.15/M + reranker infra | ~$10-30/day |
| Embeddings (steady state) | ~200k chunk updates/day × 500 tokens × ~$0.05/M | ~$5/day |
| Full re-embed (rare) | 7.5B tokens × ~$0.05/M | ~$375/event |
| Search infra | 15M chunks ≈ 60-100GB index → 3-6 node cluster | ~$3-5k/mo |
| **Blended per query** | | **~$0.015-0.03** |
| **Monthly total** | LLM ~$8-12k + infra ~$5k + connectors/ops | **~$15-25k/mo** |

Key levers, in order of impact: model tiering/routing, retrieved-chunk count (context length dominates input cost), response caching where ACLs permit, then prompt caching (worth having, but the stable prefix is only ~15-20% of input here, so it moves the bill far less than in agent or chat-with-repo workloads). At ~$20k/mo for 20k employees, this costs ~$1/employee/month - an easy ROI story if it saves minutes per week; interviewers like hearing the business framing.

## Failure modes & mitigations

| Failure | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **ACL leak** (user sees unauthorised snippet) | Severity-1 security incident | Retrieval-time filtering + late-binding recheck + permission-trap eval suite gating every release + audit logs |
| Stale answer after doc update | Wrong policy guidance | Webhook + reconciliation ingestion; freshness SLA monitoring per connector; "last updated" shown in citations |
| Hallucinated or wrong citation | Trust collapse (users verify early on) | Grounding prompt contract; citation-ID verification; sampled entailment checks; faithfulness metric in CI |
| Retrieval miss (answer exists, not found) | "It's useless" perception | Hybrid + reranker; query rewrite; log zero-recall queries into retrieval eval set |
| Contradictory sources in corpus | Confidently inconsistent answers | Dedupe; recency prior; surface both sources with dates when conflict detected |
| Prompt injection via ingested content (a wiki page saying "ignore instructions and...") | Manipulated answers | Treat retrieved text as data: delimited, non-executable framing in prompt; output moderation; no tool-execution from retrieved content in v1 |
| Provider outage / model deprecation | Assistant down | Model gateway with cross-provider fallback; pinned versions; eval-gated migration playbook |
| Connector auth expiry / silent sync failure | Slowly rotting index | Per-connector freshness lag alerting; document-count drift detection |

## Scaling & ops

- **Traffic**: 10 QPS peak is small; the online path scales with stateless replicas. The real scaling problems are ingestion backfills (initial crawl of 4M docs - rate-limit against source APIs, expect days) and index growth.
- **Index ops**: blue/green indexes for embedding-model or chunking changes - build the new index in parallel, shadow-query it, compare retrieval evals, flip an alias, keep the old one warm for rollback.
- **Model version pinning**: pin exact model versions; when a provider announces deprecation, run the full eval suite on the candidate, diff per-category scores, then canary 5% → 50% → 100%.
- **Observability**: per-stage latency (rewrite / retrieve / rerank / TTFT / total), retrieval score distributions (a drop in mean reranker score often precedes user complaints), token usage per query, per-connector sync lag, ACL-recheck failure rate.
- **Degradation ladder**: reranker down → serve RRF order; LLM down → fallback provider; retrieval down → "search is degraded" honesty, never answer from parametric memory alone.
- **Rollout plan** - lead with this sequencing; it signals pragmatism:

| Phase | Scope | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|
| Weeks 1-4 | Confluence connector only, 100-user pilot, golden set v1, tracing from day one | ≥ 75% correct on golden set; pilot NPS positive |
| Quarter 1 | All connectors, ACL sync hardened, feedback loop live, eval CI gating | 85% correctness; permission-trap suite at zero leaks; freshness SLAs met |
| Quarter 2 | Model tiering + routing for cost, response caching, multi-turn polish | Cost < $0.03/query at stable quality |
| Later | Structured-source tools (live Jira/HR lookups), proactive surfacing | Justified by logged demand, not speculation |

## Likely interviewer follow-ups

- *"A VP's strategy doc was shared with 5 people. Walk me through exactly how you guarantee the other 19,995 never see any trace of it - including in citations, autocomplete, and caches."* (Retrieval-time filter, principal expansion, late-binding recheck, per-permission-set caching, permission-trap evals.)
- *"Your users say answers are outdated. How do you debug: ingestion lag, retrieval ranking, or the model ignoring dates?"* (Freshness dashboards per connector → check if the new doc is indexed → check if it's retrieved → check if it's cited. Component evals make this a 10-minute triage.)
- *"How would you cut cost 5x if finance pushed back?"* (Routing more traffic to small models with eval-verified quality, aggressive prompt caching, fewer/shorter chunks via better reranking, response caching per permission-set, distill a small model on traced frontier outputs.)
- *"Why not fine-tune on the wiki?"* (Freshness, ACLs, attribution, and cost of continuous retraining; fine-tuning stores knowledge unverifiably and can't unlearn a revoked doc.)
- *"How do you bootstrap the golden set before you have users?"* (Expert-authored questions per department, synthetic questions generated from sampled docs then human-filtered, dogfood pilot traffic.)
- *"Slack says you can't index DMs. Does your design change?"* (Connector-level scoping; the ACL model already handles it - index only channels meeting policy; call out legal/works-council review as a real-world gate.)
- *"One of your sources tightens its API terms: no more bulk export for indexing, only a per-user search API or an MCP server. What changes?"* (Move that source to federated retrieval: at query time, call its search endpoint with the user's own delegated OAuth token so the source enforces its own ACLs, then fuse those results with the indexed ones via RRF and rerank together. Costs: you inherit its latency and rate limits, so run it in parallel with a tight timeout and degrade to "that source didn't respond"; you lose control of its ranking and freshness signals; you need per-source retrieval evals. Treat MCP tool output as untrusted retrieved text, same as any chunk.)
- *"What breaks at 10x scale - 200k employees, 150M chunks?"* (Index sharding and filtered-ANN recall under selective ACL filters; identity-graph expansion caching; ingestion parallelism against API rate limits; cost forcing more aggressive tiering.)
