# 🔎 RAG & Retrieval

RAG is the most common LLM system that companies actually ship, so it shows up in almost every AI Engineer interview loop - as conceptual questions, as a system-design round ("build search over our docs"), and as debugging scenarios ("retrieval quality dropped, go"). Expect it whether you're interviewing at a frontier lab, a big-tech applied AI team, or a startup whose whole product is RAG; interviewers use it to separate people who have shipped retrieval systems from people who have only read about them.

## Crash course

### When RAG vs long-context vs fine-tuning

This is the classic opener. The decision axes:

| Axis | RAG | Long context | Fine-tuning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Freshness** | Update index in minutes | Re-send docs every call | Retrain to update |
| **Corpus size** | Effectively unbounded | Bounded by window (frontier models commonly offer ~200k-1M tokens, and 1M ≈ a few thousand pages) | Baked into weights, lossy |
| **Cost per query** | Retrieve top-k, pay for ~2-10k context tokens | Pay for the whole corpus per call (caching helps but doesn't eliminate it) | Cheap at inference, expensive to train/maintain |
| **Attribution** | Natural - cite retrieved chunks | Possible but weaker | None - can't cite weights |
| **Access control** | Filter at retrieval time | Must pre-filter what you stuff in | Impossible per-user |
| **Best for** | Large/changing/permissioned knowledge | Small stable corpus, whole-document reasoning | Style, format, domain *behaviour* (not facts) |

Rule of thumb: **fine-tuning teaches skills and style; RAG supplies knowledge; long context is RAG's competitor only when the corpus fits and rarely changes.** They compose: many production systems fine-tune a small model *and* use RAG *and* exploit long context for the retrieved set.

```

Interviewers want you to know **every stage is a failure point** and to name where quality is usually lost: parsing and chunking (offline) and retrieval recall (online) - almost never the vector DB choice.

### Parsing: the unglamorous bottleneck

Real corpora are PDFs with multi-column layouts, scanned pages, tables that turn to soup, headers/footers polluting every chunk. If parsing mangles a table, nothing downstream can recover. Modern practice: layout-aware parsers or VLM-based parsing (render page → vision model → markdown), tables extracted to markdown/HTML with a text summary embedded alongside. For layout-heavy corpora (slides, forms, charts, scanned reports) a newer option is to skip text extraction for retrieval altogether: **visual document retrievers** (ColPali-style) embed page images directly with multi-vector late interaction, and a vision-capable LLM reads the retrieved pages. Budget more engineering time here than for anything else.

### Chunking

- **Fixed-size**: split every N tokens. Simple, breaks sentences mid-thought.
- **Recursive**: split on paragraphs → sentences → tokens until under limit. The sane default.
- **Structure-aware**: split on markdown headers / HTML sections; attach the heading path (`Doc > Section > Subsection`) to each chunk. Best when structure exists.
- **Semantic**: split where embedding similarity between adjacent sentences drops. Marginal gains, real cost.
- **Late chunking**: embed the *whole* document with a long-context embedder, then pool token embeddings per chunk - each chunk's vector sees full-document context.

Typical numbers: **256-1024 tokens per chunk, 10-20% overlap**. Small chunks → precise retrieval, fragmented context; large chunks → more context, diluted embeddings. Decouple when needed: retrieve small, return the parent ("small-to-big" / parent-document retrieval).

**Contextual retrieval** (popularised by Anthropic): before embedding, prepend a short LLM-generated blurb situating the chunk in its document ("This chunk is from ACME's Q2 filing, discussing..."). Fixes the "chunk says 'the company' - which company?" problem. Anthropic reported it cut top-20 retrieval failures by ~49% combined with contextual BM25, ~67% with reranking added. Cost is one cheap LLM call per chunk at index time - prompt caching makes it affordable.

### Embeddings

A **bi-encoder** embeds query and documents *independently* into one vector space; relevance ≈ cosine similarity. That independence is what makes pre-computation and ANN search possible - and what caps quality (no token-level interaction).

- **MTEB** (now including the multilingual MMTEB extension) is the standard embedding benchmark - useful for shortlisting, but it's public (models can be tuned on overlapping data, so leaderboard gaps overstate real gaps) and your domain isn't in it. Always eval top candidates on your own retrieval set.
- **Dimensionality**: more dims usually buy some quality with diminishing returns, and cost linearly more RAM and slower search. **Matryoshka embeddings** are trained so prefixes of the vector are themselves valid embeddings - truncate 3072→256 dims for cheap first-pass search, refine with full vectors (e.g., OpenAI's `text-embedding-3` `dimensions` parameter).
- **Fine-tuning embedders** (contrastive training on your query→doc pairs, often mined from logs) is one of the highest-ROI moves for jargon-heavy domains.

### Vector search: exact vs ANN

Exact (brute-force) search is fine to ~1M vectors - it's a matrix multiply. Beyond that, **ANN**:

- **HNSW**: multi-layer navigable-small-world graph; greedy search descends from sparse top layers to a dense bottom layer. `M` = edges per node (memory vs recall), `ef_search` = candidate beam width (recall vs latency, tune at query time), `ef_construction` = build-time quality. Great recall/latency, memory-hungry, everything in RAM.
- **IVF**: cluster vectors into cells; probe only the closest `nprobe` cells. Cheaper to build, needs training, recall suffers at cell boundaries.
- **Product quantization (PQ)**: compress vectors into subspace-codebook codes - 10-50× memory savings, lossy; usually paired with IVF or used with reranking on exact vectors.

Tradeoff triangle: **recall / latency / memory - pick two.** Report recall@k against exact search when tuning.

**Metadata filtering** breaks naive ANN: post-filtering can leave you with 3 of the requested 50 results after the filter; pre-filtering restricted to a rare tenant makes graph traversal degenerate. Good engines do *filter-aware* traversal; know that this is a hard problem and a real vendor differentiator.

**Vector DB selection**: "use pgvector until it hurts" - your data is already in Postgres, joins/filters/transactions work, one system to operate. It hurts at very large scale (roughly 50-100M+ vectors), heavy filtered-ANN workloads (pgvector 0.8's iterative index scans fixed the worst over-filtering, but dedicated engines still filter better), or when you need built-in hybrid search (Postgres full-text ranking is not BM25 - you need an extension such as ParadeDB's pg_search) - then dedicated stores (Qdrant, Milvus, Weaviate, Pinecone, Vespa, Turbopuffer) or search engines (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch - best when you already run them and need mature BM25 + faceting).

### Hybrid search & fusion

Dense retrieval fails embarrassingly on **exact-match content: IDs, SKUs, error codes, names, fresh jargon the embedder never saw**. BM25 nails those. Run both, fuse with **Reciprocal Rank Fusion**:

```python
def rrf(rankings: list[list[str]], k: int = 60) -> dict[str, float]:
    scores = {}
    for ranking in rankings:
        for rank, doc_id in enumerate(ranking, start=1):
            scores[doc_id] = scores.get(doc_id, 0) + 1.0 / (k + rank)
    return scores  # sort desc
```

RRF uses *ranks*, not scores - BM25 scores and cosine similarities live on incomparable scales, so score mixing needs fragile normalization while rank fusion just works.

A middle path worth naming: **learned sparse retrieval** (SPLADE-style). A transformer produces weighted term expansions over the vocabulary ("myocardial infarction" also lights up "heart attack"), so you get some semantic matching while serving from an ordinary inverted index. It can replace or join the lexical leg of a hybrid stack.

### Reranking

- **Bi-encoder** (first stage): query and doc encoded separately. Fast, scalable, shallow.
- **Cross-encoder** (reranker): query and doc concatenated through one transformer with full attention. Much more accurate, but O(candidates) forward passes - only feasible on the top ~50-200.
- **Late interaction (ColBERT)**: per-token embeddings, MaxSim at query time - a middle point: pre-computable like a bi-encoder, token-level matching like a cross-encoder, at ~10-100× storage cost.

Standard recipe: **hybrid retrieve top 100-200 → cross-encoder rerank → keep top 5-20.** Adds ~50-300ms and is usually the single best quality/effort tradeoff after fixing chunking.

### Query understanding

- **Rewriting**: strip conversational fluff; in multi-turn chat, rewrite "what about the pro plan?" into a standalone query using history (non-negotiable for conversational RAG).
- **Multi-query expansion**: generate 3-5 paraphrases, retrieve for all, RRF-fuse.
- **HyDE**: have the LLM hallucinate a hypothetical answer, embed *that* - answers embed closer to documents than questions do.
- **Decomposition**: split multi-hop questions into sub-queries.
- **Routing**: classify which corpus/index/tool a query needs before searching.

### Beyond single-shot: agentic RAG and GraphRAG

**Agentic RAG** = retrieval exposed as a tool the model calls in a loop: search → read → refine query → search again. Wins on multi-hop and exploratory questions; costs latency and tokens. Single-shot remains right for high-QPS, low-latency products. **GraphRAG** builds an entity/relationship graph (and community summaries) at index time - worth the significant indexing cost when questions are relational or global ("summarise themes across the corpus"), not for plain factoid lookup.

### Security: ACLs and multi-tenancy

**Enforce permissions in the retrieval filter, never via the LLM.** The model has no notion of authorization; anything in its context can be exfiltrated by prompt injection. Attach tenant/ACL metadata to every chunk, filter at query time with the *caller's* verified identity, and treat "the system prompt tells the model not to reveal other tenants' data" as an automatic interview fail. The corpus itself is an attack surface too: if anyone can add documents (wikis, tickets, uploaded files), a planted document can carry indirect prompt injection or be written to rank for target queries. Treat retrieved text as untrusted data, track provenance and trust level per source, and keep tool privileges low in any agent that reads retrieved content.

### Keeping the index fresh

An index is a derived copy of your sources, so plan for change from day one: **incremental sync** via change detection (webhooks, modified timestamps, content hashes) rather than nightly full rebuilds; **deletes and permission changes propagated fast** (a revoked ACL that still matches in the index is a security bug, not a freshness bug); and **ANN maintenance**, since HNSW tombstones deleted nodes and IVF centroids drift, so schedule compaction or rebuilds and watch recall against exact search. Version the embedding model with every vector: a new embedder means re-embedding the whole corpus, because vectors from different models are not comparable. Run the migration as a dual-write and backfill into a new index, eval it on your golden set, then cut over with the old index kept for rollback.

### Evaluation & debugging

Two layers, measured separately:

- **Retrieval**: recall@k (did the gold chunk make top-k - the metric that gates everything), MRR (first relevant rank), nDCG (graded relevance across the list). Cheap, deterministic, run on every change.
- **Generation**: faithfulness (is every claim supported by retrieved context?), answer relevance, citation correctness - typically LLM-as-judge, RAGAS-style.

Build a **golden set** (even 50-100 real queries with labelled relevant chunks) from production logs; synthetic query generation over your corpus bootstraps it. **Triage rule**: for any bad answer, first check *was the right chunk retrieved?* If no → retrieval miss (fix chunking/embedding/query understanding). If yes → generation miss (fix prompt, ordering, model). Most "hallucination" bugs are retrieval misses wearing a costume.

### Latency, cost, caching

Typical online budget: query embed ~10-50ms, ANN search ~5-50ms, rerank ~50-300ms, **LLM generation 1-10s (dominates both latency and cost)**. So optimise generation first: smaller model, fewer/shorter chunks, streaming, prompt caching (static system prompt + stable context prefix), semantic caching of full answers for repeated queries (mind ACLs and freshness on cache hits!), and embedding caches at ingest.

## Interview questions

See [questions.md](questions.md) - 60 questions with detailed answers, from basics to production war stories.

## Red flags interviewers watch for

- Jumping straight to "which vector DB" while ignoring parsing and chunking - signals no production experience, since that's where quality is actually lost.
- Treating cosine similarity scores as calibrated relevance probabilities, or fusing BM25 and dense scores by raw addition.
- No triage method: can't articulate how to tell a retrieval miss from a generation miss when shown a bad answer.
- Proposing that the LLM enforce document permissions ("the prompt tells it not to show other users' data") - an instant security fail.
- Never mentioning hybrid/lexical search; unaware that dense retrieval whiffs on IDs, error codes, and exact phrases.
- Quoting MTEB rank as the whole embedding-selection story, with no plan for domain-specific evaluation.
- "We'll evaluate it by eyeballing outputs" - no golden set, no recall@k, no separation of retrieval vs generation metrics.
- Reciting the 2023 LangChain tutorial pipeline with no awareness of contextual retrieval, reranking, agentic retrieval, or the long-context tradeoff.
