# 📅 Study Plans

Three plans depending on how much runway you have. All of them assume ~2 hours/day on weekdays and a longer weekend block. Whichever plan you pick, the method is the same:

1. **Read the crash course** (`README.md`) in each topic first - it's the compressed theory.
2. **Self-quiz with `questions.md`** - read the question, answer *out loud* before opening the collapsible answer. Speaking your answers is the single highest-leverage habit in interview prep.
3. **Type out the coding challenges yourself** - don't read the solutions first. The interview is a blank editor, not a multiple-choice test.
4. **Practice system design on a whiteboard or doc**, talking through the [framework](11-ai-system-design/README.md) before checking the case study.
5. The night before any interview: [CHEATSHEET.md](CHEATSHEET.md).
6. **Do at least one real mock before the real loop.** Use the [mock interview kit](13-interview-process-and-behavioral/mock-interview-kit.md) with a friend, or book a mock interview or mentorship session with an experienced interviewer at [enginebogie.com/u/om](https://enginebogie.com/u/om) or [topmate.io/ombharatiya](https://topmate.io/ombharatiya).

## 🔥 1-week cram (interview on the calendar)

Triage plan. Skip depth, maximise coverage of what's most likely to be asked.

| Day | Focus               | Material                                                                                                                                                                      |

## 🎯 4-week standard plan (most people)

One theme per week; coding challenges spread throughout so implementation skills compound.

### Week 1 - Foundations & the model
- Days 1-2: [01-ml-and-dl-foundations](01-ml-and-dl-foundations/README.md) - full pass.
- Days 3-5: [02-llm-fundamentals](02-llm-fundamentals/README.md) - full pass, including Advanced.
- Weekend: challenges [01 attention](12-coding-challenges/README.md), 02 BPE, 03 sampling, 04 positional encodings, 05 layernorm/softmax.

### Week 2 - Context: prompting, RAG, fine-tuning
- Days 1-2: [03-prompt-engineering-and-context](03-prompt-engineering-and-context/README.md) - full pass.
- Days 3-4: [04-rag-and-retrieval](04-rag-and-retrieval/README.md) - full pass.
- Day 5: [05-fine-tuning-and-alignment](05-fine-tuning-and-alignment/README.md) - crash course + Basic/Intermediate.
- Weekend: challenges 08 semantic search/RAG, 09 chunking; finish fine-tuning Advanced questions.

### Week 3 - Agents, evals, production
- Days 1-2: [06-agents-and-tool-use](06-agents-and-tool-use/README.md) - full pass.
- Day 3: [07-evaluation-and-observability](07-evaluation-and-observability/README.md) - full pass. Do not skip this; it's the most senior-signalling topic in the repo.
- Days 4-5: [08-inference-and-production](08-inference-and-production/README.md) - full pass.
- Weekend: challenges 06 KV cache, 10 agent loop, 11 rate limiter, 12 eval metrics.

### Week 4 - Design, safety, polish
- Day 1: [09-safety-security-and-responsible-ai](09-safety-security-and-responsible-ai/README.md) + [10-multimodal](10-multimodal/README.md) crash courses.
- Days 2-3: [11-ai-system-design](11-ai-system-design/README.md) - framework, then 3 case studies as [mock interviews](13-interview-process-and-behavioral/mock-interview-kit.md#round-3-ai-system-design-45-60-minutes): 45 minutes talking into a doc *before* reading the solution.
- Day 4: [13-interview-process-and-behavioral](13-interview-process-and-behavioral/README.md) - write your 5-7 STAR stories down.
- Day 5: challenges 07 mini-GPT forward, 13 streaming parser (the hard ones).
- Weekend: full [mock loop](13-interview-process-and-behavioral/mock-interview-kit.md) - one coding challenge cold, one design prompt from the rapid-fire list, behavioural answers out loud. Hand the kit to a friend, or record yourself and score it a day later. Then [CHEATSHEET.md](CHEATSHEET.md).

## 🏗 8-week deep plan (career transition into AI engineering)

Weeks 1-4: same as the 4-week plan, at half pace - and **build while you learn**:

- After Week 2's material → build a small RAG app over your own notes/docs **with an eval harness** (even 30 golden questions). This single project teaches more than any tutorial.
- After Week 3's material → add an agent with 2-3 tools to it, plus tracing.

Weeks 5-8:

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 5 | Depth: re-do every **Advanced** section across topics 02, 04, 05, 06, 08. Read 5-6 foundational papers from [resources](resources/README.md) (Attention, InstructGPT, LoRA, DPO, ReAct at minimum). |
| 6 | Projects: polish one portfolio project to "shows evals + error analysis + tradeoff writeup" standard (see project ideas in [13-interview-process-and-behavioral](13-interview-process-and-behavioral/README.md)). |
| 7 | System design: all 8 case studies in [11-ai-system-design](11-ai-system-design/README.md) as [timed mocks](13-interview-process-and-behavioral/mock-interview-kit.md#round-3-ai-system-design-45-60-minutes). All 13 coding challenges done cold. |
| 8 | Interview simulation: [mock loops](13-interview-process-and-behavioral/mock-interview-kit.md) with a friend, or alone with the [self-mock protocol](13-interview-process-and-behavioral/mock-interview-kit.md#self-mock-protocol-no-partner); behavioural stories rehearsed; company-specific research; [CHEATSHEET.md](CHEATSHEET.md) passes. |

## Retention tips

- **Spaced repetition beats rereading.** Second pass on a topic 3-4 days after the first, third pass a week later. The `questions.md` files are already flashcard-shaped - question first, answer hidden.
- **Track your misses.** Keep a running list of questions you fumbled; re-quiz only those on later passes.
- **Explain to a human (or a rubber duck).** If you can't explain the KV cache to a non-ML friend, you don't own it yet.
- **Do the numbers by hand once.** GPU memory maths, KV cache size, cost-per-request token maths - each done once on paper sticks forever.
