# Non Overlapping Intervals

**Topic:** [[16 Intervals|Intervals]] · **Difficulty:** Medium · [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/) · [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/problems/non-overlapping-intervals)

**Solve it in:** [[Non Overlapping Intervals]] · **Answer:** [[Non Overlapping Intervals - Solution]]

## Problem

Given an array of intervals `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, return the minimum number of intervals you must delete so that the remaining intervals are pairwise non-overlapping. Intervals that only touch at a single endpoint (e.g. `[1,2]` and `[2,3]`) are **not** considered overlapping.

## Examples

**Example 1**
```text
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: removing [1,3] leaves [1,2],[2,3],[3,4].
```

**Example 2**
```text
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3**
```text
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 10^4 <= start_i < end_i <= 5 * 10^4`

## Starter Code & Test Cases

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        pass  # your code here


if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = Solution()
    assert s.eraseOverlapIntervals([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]]) == 1
    assert s.eraseOverlapIntervals([[1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2]]) == 2
    assert s.eraseOverlapIntervals([[1, 2], [2, 3]]) == 0
    assert s.eraseOverlapIntervals([[0, 5]]) == 0
    assert s.eraseOverlapIntervals([[1, 100], [11, 22], [1, 11], [2, 12]]) == 2
    assert s.eraseOverlapIntervals([[-5, -1], [-3, 2], [0, 4], [3, 6]]) == 2
    assert s.eraseOverlapIntervals([[0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 6]]) == 2
    print("All tests passed!")
```
