# Merge K Sorted Lists - Solution

**Question:** [[Merge K Sorted Lists - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Hard

## Intuition

At every step the next output node is the smallest among the current heads of the `k` lists. A min-heap holding at most one node per list gives that minimum in `O(log k)`. Python's `heapq` cannot compare `ListNode`s, so we push `(val, index, node)` tuples with the list index as a tie-breaker.

## Approach

1. Push `(head.val, i, head)` for each non-empty list into a min-heap.
2. Pop the smallest tuple, append its node to the result tail.
3. If that node has a `next`, push `(next.val, i, next)`.
4. Repeat until the heap is empty; return `dummy.next`.

## Code

```python
from typing import List, Optional
import heapq

# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        heap = [(node.val, i, node) for i, node in enumerate(lists) if node]
        heapq.heapify(heap)

        dummy = tail = ListNode()
        while heap:
            _, i, node = heapq.heappop(heap)    # i breaks ties so nodes are never compared
            tail.next = node
            tail = node
            if node.next:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, i, node.next))
        tail.next = None
        return dummy.next
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(N log k)` — `N` total nodes, each pushed/popped once on a heap of size `<= k`.
- **Space:** `O(k)` — the heap; nodes are re-linked in place.

## Other Approaches

- **Divide and conquer:** merge lists in pairs (like merge sort), halving the count each round — Time `O(N log k)`, Space `O(1)` iterative (`O(log k)` recursive).
- **Merge one by one:** fold `mergeTwoLists` across the array — Time `O(N k)`, Space `O(1)`.
- **Collect all values and sort:** Time `O(N log N)`, Space `O(N)`.

## Key Takeaway

"k-way merge" → min-heap of the k frontier elements. In Python, add a unique tie-breaker to heap tuples when the payload is not comparable.
