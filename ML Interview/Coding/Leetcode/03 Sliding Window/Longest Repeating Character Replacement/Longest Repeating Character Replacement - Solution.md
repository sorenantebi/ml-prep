# Longest Repeating Character Replacement - Solution

**Question:** [[Longest Repeating Character Replacement - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

A window can be made uniform iff `window_length - count_of_most_frequent_char <= k`. Slide a window, counting characters, and shrink from the left when this fails. We only need the best `maxf` ever seen: the answer can only grow when `maxf` grows, so a stale (too large) `maxf` never produces a wrong larger answer.

## Approach

1. Keep `count` per letter, `l = 0`, `maxf = 0`, `best = 0`.
2. For each `r`:
   - Increment `count[s[r]]`, update `maxf = max(maxf, count[s[r]])`.
   - If `(r - l + 1) - maxf > k`, decrement `count[s[l]]` and move `l` right by one.
   - Update `best = max(best, r - l + 1)`.
3. Return `best`.

## Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict


class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        count = defaultdict(int)
        l = maxf = best = 0
        for r, c in enumerate(s):
            count[c] += 1
            maxf = max(maxf, count[c])
            # too many characters to replace -> slide the window
            if (r - l + 1) - maxf > k:
                count[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1
            best = max(best, r - l + 1)
        return best
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — each index enters and leaves the window at most once.
- **Space:** `O(1)` — at most 26 counters.

## Other Approaches

- **Recompute max each step:** use `max(count.values())` instead of the historical `maxf` and shrink with a `while` loop — Time `O(26n)`, Space `O(1)`; easier to reason about.
- **Per-letter windows:** for each of the 26 letters, find the longest window with at most `k` other letters — Time `O(26n)`, Space `O(1)`.

## Key Takeaway

For "longest window that can be fixed with k changes", the validity test is `len - maxFreq <= k`; never decreasing `maxf` is a safe optimization because only a larger `maxf` can improve the answer.
