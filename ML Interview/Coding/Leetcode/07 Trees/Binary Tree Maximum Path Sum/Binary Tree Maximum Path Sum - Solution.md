# Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum - Solution

**Question:** [[Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Hard

## Intuition

Every path has one highest node where it may bend, using a downward branch on each side. A post-order DFS can return, for each node, the best **single downward branch** starting there (`node.val + max(0, left_branch, right_branch)` — negative branches are dropped). At the same node, the best path bending there is `node.val + max(0, left) + max(0, right)`, which updates a global maximum.

## Approach

1. Initialize `best = root.val` (a path must have at least one node).
2. `gain(node)`: return `0` for null.
3. Compute `l = max(gain(left), 0)` and `r = max(gain(right), 0)` — ignore branches that would reduce the sum.
4. Update `best = max(best, node.val + l + r)` (path bending at this node).
5. Return `node.val + max(l, r)` — only one branch can continue upward to the parent.
6. Call `gain(root)` and return `best`.

## Code

```python
from typing import Optional

# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        best = root.val

        def gain(node):
            nonlocal best
            if not node:
                return 0
            l = max(gain(node.left), 0)     # drop negative branches
            r = max(gain(node.right), 0)
            best = max(best, node.val + l + r)  # path that turns at this node
            return node.val + max(l, r)     # parent may extend only one side

        gain(root)
        return best
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — each node is visited once.
- **Space:** `O(h)` — recursion stack.

## Other Approaches

- **Brute force over every bend point:** for each node, separately compute the best downward path in each subtree — Time `O(n^2)`, Space `O(h)`.

## Key Takeaway

Same skeleton as Diameter of Binary Tree: the DFS **returns** the best one-sided extension while it **records** the best two-sided combination; clamp negative contributions to zero.
