# Invert Binary Tree - Solution

**Question:** [[Invert Binary Tree - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Easy

## Intuition

The mirror of a tree is the root with its two subtrees swapped, where each subtree is itself mirrored. That recursive definition maps directly onto a DFS: invert both children, then swap them.

## Approach

1. If `root` is null, return null.
2. Recursively invert `root.left` and `root.right`.
3. Assign the inverted right subtree to `root.left` and the inverted left subtree to `root.right`.
4. Return `root`.

## Code

```python
from typing import Optional

# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return None
        # tuple assignment evaluates both recursive calls before swapping
        root.left, root.right = self.invertTree(root.right), self.invertTree(root.left)
        return root
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — each node is visited once.
- **Space:** `O(h)` — recursion stack depth equals tree height (`O(n)` worst case for a skewed tree).

## Other Approaches

- **Iterative BFS/DFS:** use a queue or stack; for each popped node swap its children and enqueue them — Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)` (widest level).

## Key Takeaway

Many tree problems reduce to "do something to the node, recurse on children" — trust the recursive definition and handle the null base case.
