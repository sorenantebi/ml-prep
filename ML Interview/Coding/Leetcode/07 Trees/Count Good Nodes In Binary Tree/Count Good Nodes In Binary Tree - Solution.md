# Count Good Nodes In Binary Tree - Solution

**Question:** [[Count Good Nodes In Binary Tree - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

Whether a node is good depends only on the maximum value seen on the path from the root to it. So carry that running maximum down a DFS: a node is good iff `node.val >= path_max`, and its children inherit `max(path_max, node.val)`.

## Approach

1. Push `(root, root.val)` onto a stack (the root's path max is itself).
2. Pop `(node, mx)`; if `node.val >= mx`, count it.
3. Compute `mx = max(mx, node.val)` and push each non-null child with this new `mx`.
4. Return the count when the stack is empty.

## Code

```python
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        good = 0
        stack = [(root, root.val)]       # (node, max value on path above it)
        while stack:
            node, mx = stack.pop()
            if node.val >= mx:
                good += 1
            mx = max(mx, node.val)
            if node.left:
                stack.append((node.left, mx))
            if node.right:
                stack.append((node.right, mx))
        return good
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — each node is visited once.
- **Space:** `O(h)` — the explicit stack (`O(n)` worst case); iterative to avoid recursion limits on 10^5-node chains.

## Other Approaches

- **Recursive DFS:** `dfs(node, mx)` returning `(node.val >= mx) + dfs(left, new_mx) + dfs(right, new_mx)` — Time `O(n)`, Space `O(h)` recursion.
- **BFS with `(node, mx)` pairs:** same logic with a queue — Time `O(n)`, Space `O(w)`.

## Key Takeaway

When a node's property depends on its ancestors, pass the needed summary (max, min, sum, bounds) **down** the traversal as a parameter.
