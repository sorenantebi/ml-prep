# Letter Combinations of a Phone Number - Solution

**Question:** [[Letter Combinations of a Phone Number - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

Each digit is an independent choice among 3–4 letters, so the answers are the leaves of a tree with one level per digit. Backtracking picks a letter for the current digit, recurses to the next digit, and undoes the choice.

## Approach

1. If `digits` is empty, return `[]`.
2. Map each digit to its letters.
3. `dfs(i)`: if `i == len(digits)`, record `"".join(path)`.
4. Otherwise for each letter of `digits[i]`: append it, recurse with `i + 1`, pop.

## Code

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
        if not digits:
            return []
        keypad = {"2": "abc", "3": "def", "4": "ghi", "5": "jkl",
                  "6": "mno", "7": "pqrs", "8": "tuv", "9": "wxyz"}
        res, path = [], []

        def dfs(i: int) -> None:
            if i == len(digits):
                res.append("".join(path))
                return
            for ch in keypad[digits[i]]:
                path.append(ch)
                dfs(i + 1)
                path.pop()

        dfs(0)
        return res
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n * 4^n)` — up to `4^n` strings, each joined in `O(n)`.
- **Space:** `O(n)` — recursion depth and path (output excluded).

## Other Approaches

- **Iterative BFS-style expansion:** start with `[""]` and for each digit replace the list with every prefix extended by each letter — same Time, Space output-sized.
- **Cartesian product:** `["".join(p) for p in itertools.product(*(keypad[d] for d in digits))]` — same complexity.

## Key Takeaway

When each position has an independent set of options, the answer is a Cartesian product — backtracking with one recursion level per position generates it cleanly.
