# Swim In Rising Water

**Topic:** [[12 Advanced Graphs|Advanced Graphs]] · **Difficulty:** Hard · [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/) · [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/problems/swim-in-rising-water)

**Solve it in:** [[Swim In Rising Water]] · **Answer:** [[Swim In Rising Water - Solution]]

## Problem

You are given an `n x n` grid where `grid[r][c]` is the elevation of cell `(r, c)`; the values are a permutation of `0 .. n^2 - 1`. Rain starts falling, and at time `t` the water level everywhere is `t`.

You may swim from a cell to a 4-directionally adjacent cell only if both cells have elevation at most `t`. Swimming any distance takes zero time. Starting at `(0, 0)`, return the smallest time `t` at which you can reach `(n - 1, n - 1)`.

## Examples

**Example 1**
```text
Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The target cell itself has elevation 3, so you must wait until t = 3.
```

**Example 2**
```text
Input: grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
```

**Example 3**
```text
Input: grid = [[0]]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

- `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] < n^2`
- All values in `grid` are distinct.

## Starter Code & Test Cases

```python
from typing import List
import heapq


class Solution:
    def swimInWater(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        pass  # your code here


if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = Solution()
    assert s.swimInWater([[0,2],[1,3]]) == 3
    assert s.swimInWater([[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]) == 16
    assert s.swimInWater([[0]]) == 0
    assert s.swimInWater([[3,2],[0,1]]) == 3
    assert s.swimInWater([[0,1,2],[5,4,3],[6,7,8]]) == 8
    assert s.swimInWater([[0,8,7],[1,6,5],[2,3,4]]) == 4
    print("All tests passed!")
```
