# Happy Number

**Topic:** [[17 Math & Geometry|Math & Geometry]] · **Difficulty:** Easy · [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/) · [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/problems/non-cyclical-number)

**Solve it in:** [[Happy Number]] · **Answer:** [[Happy Number - Solution]]

## Problem

Determine whether a positive integer `n` is **happy**.

Repeatedly replace the number with the sum of the squares of its digits. If this process eventually reaches `1`, the number is happy and you return `true`. Otherwise the process loops forever in a cycle that never contains `1`, and you return `false`.

## Examples

**Example 1**
```text
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation: 1^2 + 9^2 = 82 -> 8^2 + 2^2 = 68 -> 6^2 + 8^2 = 100 -> 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
```

**Example 2**
```text
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: 2 -> 4 -> 16 -> 37 -> 58 -> 89 -> 145 -> 42 -> 20 -> 4 -> ... (cycle without 1)
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

## Starter Code & Test Cases

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        pass  # your code here


if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = Solution()
    assert s.isHappy(19) is True
    assert s.isHappy(2) is False
    assert s.isHappy(1) is True
    assert s.isHappy(7) is True
    assert s.isHappy(4) is False
    assert s.isHappy(100) is True
    assert s.isHappy(116) is False
    assert s.isHappy(2147483647) is False
    print("All tests passed!")
```
