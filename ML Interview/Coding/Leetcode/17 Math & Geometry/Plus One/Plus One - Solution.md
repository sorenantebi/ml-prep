# Plus One - Solution

**Question:** [[Plus One - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Easy

## Intuition

Add from the least significant digit, as in long addition. A digit less than 9 can be incremented, and we are done. A 9 becomes 0 and the carry moves one place left. A carry only survives past the front of the array if every digit was 9, in which case the answer is `1` followed by zeros.

## Approach

1. Iterate `i` from the last index down to `0`.
2. If `digits[i] < 9`, increment it and return `digits`.
3. Otherwise set `digits[i] = 0` and keep going, since the carry continues.
4. If the loop finishes, every digit was 9: return `[1] + digits`.

## Code

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(digits) - 1, -1, -1):
            if digits[i] < 9:
                digits[i] += 1
                return digits
            digits[i] = 0  # 9 + 1 -> 0, carry continues left
        return [1] + digits  # all digits were 9
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)`: in the worst case (all 9s) every digit is visited once.
- **Space:** `O(1)` extra, since the input is modified in place. Only the all-9s case allocates a new array of size `n + 1`.

## Other Approaches

- **Convert to int and back:** `int("".join(map(str, digits))) + 1`, then split it back into digits. This works in Python thanks to big integers but misses the point of the problem. Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)`.

## Key Takeaway

For digit-array arithmetic, walk from the least significant end and carry. Often you can stop as soon as the carry disappears.
