# Longest Common Subsequence - Solution

**Question:** [[Longest Common Subsequence - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

Compare prefixes. If the last characters of `text1[:i]` and `text2[:j]` match, they can both end the LCS, giving `1 + LCS(i-1, j-1)`. Otherwise one of them is unused, giving `max(LCS(i-1, j), LCS(i, j-1))`. This is a classic 2-D DP that can be rolled into one row.

## Approach

1. Let `dp[j]` hold the LCS of the current prefix of `text1` with `text2[:j]`; start with all zeros.
2. For each character `a` of `text1`, sweep `j` from 1 to `len(text2)`, keeping `prev` = the old `dp[j-1]` (the diagonal value):
   - If `a == text2[j-1]`: `dp[j] = prev + 1`.
   - Else: `dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-1])`.
3. Return `dp[-1]`.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        if len(text2) > len(text1):
            text1, text2 = text2, text1  # keep the row as short as possible
        dp = [0] * (len(text2) + 1)
        for a in text1:
            prev = 0  # dp[i-1][j-1] (diagonal)
            for j in range(1, len(text2) + 1):
                tmp = dp[j]  # dp[i-1][j], becomes next diagonal
                if a == text2[j - 1]:
                    dp[j] = prev + 1
                else:
                    dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - 1])
                prev = tmp
        return dp[-1]
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(m * n)` — every pair of prefix lengths is evaluated once.
- **Space:** `O(min(m, n))` — one row over the shorter string.

## Other Approaches

- **Full 2-D table:** `dp[i][j]` over all prefix pairs; also lets you reconstruct the subsequence — Time `O(mn)`, Space `O(mn)`.
- **Memoized recursion on `(i, j)`:** same recurrence top-down — Time `O(mn)`, Space `O(mn)` plus recursion stack.

## Key Takeaway

Two-sequence DP: index the state by a prefix of each string; match -> diagonal + 1, mismatch -> best of dropping one character. When rolling into 1-D, save the diagonal before overwriting.
