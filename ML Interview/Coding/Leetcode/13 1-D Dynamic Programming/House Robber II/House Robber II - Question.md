# House Robber II

**Topic:** [[13 1-D Dynamic Programming|1-D Dynamic Programming]] · **Difficulty:** Medium · [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/) · [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/problems/house-robber-ii)

**Solve it in:** [[House Robber II]] · **Answer:** [[House Robber II - Solution]]

## Problem

Same as House Robber, except the houses are arranged in a **circle**: the first and last houses are adjacent. Given `nums[i]`, the money in house `i`, return the maximum amount you can take without taking from two adjacent houses.

## Examples

**Example 1**
```text
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Houses 0 and 2 are neighbours, so you can't take both.
```

**Example 2**
```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3**
```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Starter Code & Test Cases

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        pass  # your code here


if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = Solution()
    assert s.rob([2,3,2]) == 3
    assert s.rob([1,2,3,1]) == 4
    assert s.rob([1,2,3]) == 3
    assert s.rob([5]) == 5
    assert s.rob([1,2]) == 2
    assert s.rob([200,3,140,20,10]) == 340
    assert s.rob([0]) == 0
    print("All tests passed!")
```
