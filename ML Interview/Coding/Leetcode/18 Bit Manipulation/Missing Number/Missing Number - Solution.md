# Missing Number - Solution

**Question:** [[Missing Number - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Easy

## Intuition

XOR every index `0..n` together with every value in `nums`. Each number that is present appears twice (once as an index or `n`, once as a value) and cancels out, leaving only the missing number. This avoids the overflow concern that the sum formula has in fixed-width languages.

## Approach

1. Start with `res = n`, because the indices only cover `0..n-1`.
2. For each `i, num`: `res ^= i ^ num`.
3. Return `res`.

## Code

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = len(nums)  # include n, since indices only go to n-1
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            res ^= i ^ num  # everything present cancels in pairs
        return res
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)`: one pass.
- **Space:** `O(1)`.

## Other Approaches

- **Gauss sum:** `n * (n + 1) // 2 - sum(nums)`. Time `O(n)`, Space `O(1)`. It could overflow with fixed-width integers; this is safe in Python.
- **Hash set or sort:** check each `0..n` against a set, or sort and look for the first `nums[i] != i`. Time `O(n)` / `O(n log n)`, Space `O(n)` / `O(1)`.

## Key Takeaway

Find the missing element by XOR-ing the expected set with the actual set, so that everything present cancels out. The sum difference does the same job when overflow isn't a concern.
