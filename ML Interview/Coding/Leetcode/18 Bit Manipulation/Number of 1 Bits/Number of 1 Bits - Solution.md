# Number of 1 Bits - Solution

**Question:** [[Number of 1 Bits - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Easy

## Intuition

`n & (n - 1)` clears the lowest set bit of `n`. Subtracting 1 flips that bit to 0 and turns every 0 below it into a 1, and the AND then wipes all of those positions. Repeating this until `n` is 0 takes exactly as many steps as there are set bits.

## Approach

1. Set `count = 0`.
2. While `n` is non-zero: `n &= n - 1` and `count += 1`.
3. Return `count`.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n:
            n &= n - 1  # drop the lowest set bit
            count += 1
        return count
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(k)`: `k` is the number of set bits, at most 32.
- **Space:** `O(1)`.

## Other Approaches

- **Check each bit:** `count += n & 1; n >>= 1` until `n` is 0. Time `O(32)`, Space `O(1)`.
- **Built-in:** `bin(n).count("1")` or `n.bit_count()` (Python 3.10+). Time `O(log n)`, Space `O(log n)` for the `bin` string.

## Key Takeaway

`n & (n - 1)` removes the lowest set bit. It is used for popcount, for checking powers of two (`n & (n - 1) == 0`), and for walking the subsets of a bitmask.
