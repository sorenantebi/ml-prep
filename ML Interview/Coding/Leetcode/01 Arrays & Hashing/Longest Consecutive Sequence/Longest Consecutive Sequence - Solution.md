# Longest Consecutive Sequence - Solution

**Question:** [[Longest Consecutive Sequence - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

Put all values in a hash set. A number `x` starts a sequence only if `x - 1` is not in the set; from each such start we count upward while `x + 1, x + 2, ...` exist. Every number is visited by at most one upward walk, so the total work is linear.

## Approach

1. Build `num_set = set(nums)`.
2. For each `x` in `num_set`, skip it if `x - 1` is in the set (it is not a sequence start).
3. Otherwise walk `y = x` upward while `y + 1` is in the set, counting the length.
4. Track and return the maximum length (0 for an empty input).

## Code

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        num_set = set(nums)
        best = 0
        for x in num_set:
            if x - 1 in num_set:  # not the start of a run; its start will handle it
                continue
            length = 1
            while x + length in num_set:
                length += 1
            best = max(best, length)
        return best
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — each element is part of exactly one upward walk, and set lookups are `O(1)` average.
- **Space:** `O(n)` — the hash set.

## Other Approaches

- **Sort and scan:** sort, skip duplicates, and count runs of `+1` steps — Time `O(n log n)`, Space `O(1)` to `O(n)`.
- **Union-Find:** union `x` with `x + 1` when both exist and take the largest component — Time `~O(n)`, Space `O(n)`.

## Key Takeaway

Only start expanding from the beginning of a sequence (`x - 1` absent); this "start-only" check turns a naive quadratic scan into linear time.
