# Top K Frequent Elements - Solution

**Question:** [[Top K Frequent Elements - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

A frequency can be at most `n`, so we can bucket values by their count: `buckets[f]` lists every value that appears exactly `f` times. Walking the buckets from the highest frequency downward yields the most frequent values first, avoiding any comparison sort.

## Approach

1. Count occurrences of each value with a hash map.
2. Create `n + 1` empty buckets and put each value into `buckets[count]`.
3. Iterate frequencies from `n` down to `1`, collecting values until `k` have been gathered.
4. Return the collected values.

## Code

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        count = Counter(nums)
        buckets = [[] for _ in range(len(nums) + 1)]  # index = frequency
        for value, freq in count.items():
            buckets[freq].append(value)

        result = []
        for freq in range(len(buckets) - 1, 0, -1):  # highest frequency first
            for value in buckets[freq]:
                result.append(value)
                if len(result) == k:
                    return result
        return result
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — counting and bucketing are linear, and the bucket scan touches at most `n + 1` buckets.
- **Space:** `O(n)` — the counter and the buckets.

## Other Approaches

- **Min-heap of size `k`:** push `(freq, value)` and pop when the heap exceeds `k` (or `heapq.nlargest`) — Time `O(n log k)`, Space `O(n)`.
- **Sort by frequency:** sort distinct values by count descending — Time `O(n log n)`, Space `O(n)`.
- **Quickselect on frequencies:** Time `O(n)` average, Space `O(n)`.

## Key Takeaway

When the key you sort by is bounded by `n` (like a frequency), bucket sort gives linear time; otherwise a size-`k` heap is the go-to for "top k".
