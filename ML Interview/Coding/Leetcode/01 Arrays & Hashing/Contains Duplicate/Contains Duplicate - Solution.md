# Contains Duplicate - Solution

**Question:** [[Contains Duplicate - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Easy

## Intuition

A duplicate exists exactly when we encounter a value we have already seen. A hash set gives `O(1)` average membership checks, so a single pass that remembers seen values answers the question and can stop early at the first repeat.

## Approach

1. Create an empty set `seen`.
2. Walk through `nums`; if the current value is already in `seen`, return `True`.
3. Otherwise add it to `seen`.
4. If the loop finishes, all values are distinct: return `False`.

## Code

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        seen = set()
        for x in nums:
            if x in seen:  # second occurrence found
                return True
            seen.add(x)
        return False
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — one pass with `O(1)` average set operations.
- **Space:** `O(n)` — the set may hold every element.

## Other Approaches

- **Sort then compare neighbours:** duplicates become adjacent after sorting — Time `O(n log n)`, Space `O(1)` to `O(n)` depending on the sort.
- **Length comparison:** `len(set(nums)) != len(nums)` — Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)` (no early exit).

## Key Takeaway

"Have I seen this before?" is the canonical hash-set question; trade `O(n)` memory for linear time instead of sorting.
