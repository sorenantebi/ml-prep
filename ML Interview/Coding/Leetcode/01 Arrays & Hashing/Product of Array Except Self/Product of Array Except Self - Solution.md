# Product of Array Except Self - Solution

**Question:** [[Product of Array Except Self - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

The product of everything except `nums[i]` is (product of everything to its left) × (product of everything to its right). We can store the left prefix products in the output array in one pass, then sweep from the right with a running suffix product and multiply it in, all without division.

## Approach

1. Initialize `answer = [1] * n`.
2. Left pass: keep `prefix = 1`; for each `i`, set `answer[i] = prefix`, then `prefix *= nums[i]`.
3. Right pass: keep `suffix = 1`; for `i` from `n - 1` down to `0`, do `answer[i] *= suffix`, then `suffix *= nums[i]`.
4. Return `answer`.

## Code

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        answer = [1] * n
        prefix = 1
        for i in range(n):
            answer[i] = prefix  # product of nums[0..i-1]
            prefix *= nums[i]
        suffix = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            answer[i] *= suffix  # times product of nums[i+1..n-1]
            suffix *= nums[i]
        return answer
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — two linear passes.
- **Space:** `O(1)` extra — only `prefix`/`suffix` scalars; the output array is not counted.

## Other Approaches

- **Separate prefix and suffix arrays:** build both arrays then multiply element-wise — Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)`.
- **Division with zero counting:** total product / `nums[i]`, special-casing one or more zeros — Time `O(n)`, Space `O(1)`, but disallowed by the problem.

## Key Takeaway

"Everything except index i" problems decompose into prefix and suffix aggregates; reuse the output array to hold one of them for `O(1)` extra space.
