# Two Sum II Input Array Is Sorted - Solution

**Question:** [[Two Sum II Input Array Is Sorted - Question]] · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Intuition

With a sorted array, start one pointer at each end. If their sum is too large, the only way to shrink it is to move the right pointer left; if too small, move the left pointer right. Each move safely discards a value that cannot be part of the answer.

## Approach

1. Set `l = 0`, `r = len(numbers) - 1`.
2. While `l < r`, compute `s = numbers[l] + numbers[r]`:
   - If `s == target`, return `[l + 1, r + 1]`.
   - If `s > target`, decrement `r`; otherwise increment `l`.

## Code

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        l, r = 0, len(numbers) - 1
        while l < r:
            s = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
            if s == target:
                return [l + 1, r + 1]  # 1-indexed
            if s > target:
                r -= 1
            else:
                l += 1
        return []
```

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` — pointers move toward each other, at most `n` steps total.
- **Space:** `O(1)` — two indices.

## Other Approaches

- **Binary search per element:** for each `i`, binary search `target - numbers[i]` in the suffix — Time `O(n log n)`, Space `O(1)`.
- **Hash map (Two Sum I):** Time `O(n)`, Space `O(n)` — ignores the sorted property and breaks the constant-space requirement.

## Key Takeaway

Sorted input plus a pair-sum target means opposite-end two pointers: the comparison with the target tells you exactly which pointer to move.
